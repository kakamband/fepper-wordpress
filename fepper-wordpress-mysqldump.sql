guidelines for the WordPress Plugin Directory were <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-team-revamps-guidelines-invites-feedback-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">opened up on GitHub for public feedback</a>. This transparent and open process of updating the guidelines resulted in more than a dozen contributors submitting pull requests with improvements to the language and content. The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">revamped guidelines</a> have now replaced the previous ones with language and expectations that are clearer and easier to understand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to rewriting the guidelines, we took the time to codify the expectations of developers and cost of not abiding by the guidelines, as well as a reminder that we do remove plugins for security issues,&#8221; plugin team member Mika Epstein said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/11/01/revised-guidelines-are-live/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;We are doing our best to be transparent of what we expect from you and, in return, what you can expect from us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After several incidents this year where unclear guidelines contributed to confusion on issues like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-cracks-down-on-incentivized-reviews-despite-lack-of-official-guideline\" target=\"_blank\">incentivized reviews</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-will-no-longer-accept-frameworks\" target=\"_blank\">developers submitting frameworks</a>, the plugin team made the jump to update the five-year-old document. Although there are not major changes, some of the guidelines were considerably expanded for clarity. This includes #9: &#8220;The plugin and its developers must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive.&#8221; The list was updated with several more examples of infractions that would land under this category.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a massive undertaking to re-write guidelines in the public eye in a way that won’t pull the rug out from anyone,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;Our goal was to clarify, not totally change, but also to address the needs of an ever changing technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because the plugin directory was created to serve the WordPress project and its users, it doesn&#8217;t function like many other popular directories and marketplaces. Clear language and expectations are important, especially with WordPress&#8217; growing international user base. The newly updated guidelines should cut down on incidents where the plugin team has to enforce guidelines that were not explicitly documented.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Nov 2016 06:03:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.7.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=260750\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://buddypress.org/2016/11/buddypress-2-7-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:888:\"<p>BuddyPress 2.7.2 is now available.

The social activities will be available as a separate purchase of $50 when buying your tickets. To take full advantage of the event, organizers suggest that attendees fly in on Wednesday, April 5th and leave on Sunday, April 9th.</p>\n<p>Tickets have yet to go on sale and the speaker lineup is in the process of being finalized.

Clicking the label displays a blank pane with a short description of what users can do. Clicking the help icon displays a short explanation of what CSS is with a link to a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Know_Your_Sources#CSS\">help document</a> on the Codex. The Additional CSS pane is more like a text area than an editor.</p>\n<p>Unlike Jetpack&#8217;s Edit CSS module, the editor in the customizer lacks line numbers, colored text, and other conveniences. However, these are features that are likely to be added in future iterations.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JetpacksEditCSSModule.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63484\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JetpacksEditCSSModule.png?resize=601%2C423&ssl=1\" alt=\"Jetpack\'s Edit CSS Module\" /></a>Jetpack&#8217;s Edit CSS Module\n<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind before using Additional CSS. First, it does not have revision support enabled. Weston Ruter, WordPress core committer, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35395#comment:76\">says</a> revision support is disabled by default and requires a plugin.</p>\n<p>Second, changes are theme specific and are not global. Luke Cavanagh <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35395#comment:83\">has inquired</a> on whether an option will be added in the future to enable global CSS changes which could come in handy for making tweaks for active plugins.</p>\n<p>During testing, I didn&#8217;t encounter any issues with writing or pasting CSS code into the Additional CSS area.

To do that, I discovered the power of self-reflection and began a journey to understand the very core of who I am. I’m not a hero, but I know when to be one. When fear and worry appears I recognize it. And then I conquer it.</p>\n<p>If you don’t think you are good enough or smart enough to be and have what you want in life, then fear is holding you back, too. The story that follows is both inspired by and written for you.</p>\n<p>You may not believe it yet, but you’ve already got what it takes within yourself to live a happier life.</p>\n<p>Let me show you how you can discover it.</p>\n<h3>This Is Me Today.</h3>\n<p>I am a Norwegian expat in Canada. Here, I live in the heart of the world’s most multicultural city, Toronto, and lead a happy and full life with my wife and our furkid. By so many standards around our globe, my lifestyle is privileged. It hasn’t come easy, and I often am reminded of how fortunate I am.</p>\n<p>I never could have envisioned living this life when I, one and a half decades ago, trapped, lost and without hope and goals for the future, decided on a whim to learn how to code and develop websites. I read about people making a living out of it, yet didn’t believe it was something I myself could do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a year of trying, failing and learning I began to prove myself wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today I work at XWP, a global company powered remotely by people working from their homes around the world. Our core expertise is WordPress. Our team dreams up and engineers platforms, tools and workflows that let companies more effortlessly connect with their audience. We help our clients to sell and deliver their services and product, and grow communities that serves as an extension of their businesses.</p>\n<p>XWP’s roots date back to 2004, and I’ve been part of the journey for 10 of those years. In my current role I serve a team of 40 people. I was fully entrusted with the care of the company and the people working there by its owner in 2014. I am responsible for guiding our company vision, strategy and direction while ensuring its healthy growth and great performance. A vital area of my mandate is helping each person on our team have meaningful, impactful work in a purpose filled role they can be successful in.</p>\n<p>The workplace environment and my role allows me to connect directly with my own professional purpose &#8211; to be a catalyst and energizer in helping people discover their personal and professional strengths, and uncover the opportunities and possibilities it can bring in their life. At work, I am also able to apply my strength of bringing people together to build unity and community.</p>\n<p>At home, I am at my happiest when spending time with my wife and our senior rescue lab. The love I give and receive, our deep and our silly conversations together, and all the laughs we share are things that fills me up and re-energizes me. Cooking and serving food, especially for a small crowd, also energizes me. I’m known for preparing elaborate meals with menus that can take days to plan to get “just right”. Earlier this year I completed a Culinary Arts program at George Brown College here in Toronto to further explore my passion for food and for service.</p>\n<p>My whole life I’ve found joy in doing sports. In my youth I actively played football/soccer and volleyball and did well with it. Since moving to Toronto I’ve taken up running, and I’ve discovered a way to keep myself motivated to exercise and train is to sign up for running races. It also has become a way I get to compete against myself, measuring my improvement to pace and finishing times. In 2015 I ran my first half-marathon. My goal was to run a full marathon this year, but I pushed myself too hard and strained a muscle, so I’ll run it next year instead. I am looking forward to passing that 42.2km mark in under 4 hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I lead my life guided by a set of deeply held values, principles and beliefs:</li>\n<li>I value compassion, kindness, care, integrity and authenticity.</li>\n<li>I believe in serving others before myself.</li>\n<li>I offer my trust from the very start of a relationship, choosing to believe everyone has good intent in their heart.</li>\n<li>I strive to listen to and understand others. This lets me be empathic which will help me serve others needs better.</li>\n<li>I am of the opinion that everyone deserves to live a happy, fulfilling life, regardless of any personal flaw.</li>\n<li>I recognize my flaws and build up my strengths around them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am so grateful to have discovered all of this about myself at an early stage in life so I can live authentically who I am today and embrace all the opportunities it is affording me.</p>\n<h3>When I Discovered My Strengths.</h3>\n<p>I was invited to join the team at XHTMLized (today known as XFive, and a sister company of XWP), as a front-end developer in 2006. There was no shortage of work, the demand for its PSD-to-HTML service was growing rapidly. Opportunities to be part of great projects with exciting brands kept coming my way, and I continued to hone and develop my skills as a developer and project lead. Opportunities to be part of building the company surfaced, and I began investing time into helping the business grow.</p>\n<p>Trying on and wearing the hats of different areas of the business was encouraged. I served in a variety of roles that touched on most every function of the business, including project management, sales and account management, finance and HR. I would often run into new and unfamiliar territory. Through my own determination I battled my fear of failure, and figured out how to do the things that needed to be done. I was surrounded by people who believed in me and recognized my strengths and achievements even when I wasn’t able to see them myself.</p>\n<p>It was here that my belief in trust, empowerment, collaboration and autonomy in the workplace was shaped because I was experiencing how powerful it was first hand.</p>\n<p>When our WordPress-focused team came together to form XWP in 2014, the opportunity to lead the company surfaced.</p>\n<p>While faced with startup jitters and challenges of building up a brand new business, and while working with a team of enormous potential, I became uncertain of my own place in it. I questioned my ability to add value, to set us up in a way that would help us fulfill our potential. I began questioning my professional future. To deal with this uncertainty, I chose to start working with a professional coach. It was a decision that would greatly alter how I viewed myself and where I was in my career.</p>\n<p>Through the work with my coach, I was introduced to the concept of <em>unique ability</em>, a belief that at the heart of who you are lies the secret to your greatest success, best quality of life, and biggest contribution to the world. It gave me new hope. I began the work to define my own unique ability. I discovered the concept of <em>Servant Leadership</em>, the understanding that leadership is not for personal power or gain but it is in service to others. This deeply resonated with me. I had seen traits of Servant Leadership in people I worked with and I was unknowingly applying aspects of it in my own life.</p>\n<p>Within 6 months of coaching I had made the decision to pursue the role I have in the company today. I was believing in myself again and recognized that I could continue to make meaningful contribution and impact at the workplace I already had.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of a quote that has served me well over the last decade of my life and often comes to mind at times when I forget my strengths:</p>\n<p>“You must do the thing you think you cannot do”. &#8211; Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n<h3>A Personal Sidestory.</h3>\n<p>My biggest personal transformation to date began when I found myself at rock bottom.</p>\n<p>I was at a complete and utter dead end in most areas of my life when I chose to end a personal relationship that had kept me abroad in the U.S for 12 years. I had come to the realization that in order to have the positive change I needed for myself, I had to be the change. I found the courage within to take the action needed to close an unfulfilling and unhappy chapter of life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To do that, I needed to break with almost everything around me and start fresh &#8211; and it was <em>terrifying.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>And exhilarating. But mostly, it was just terrifying. I had to let go of people I had grown close to and become dependent on. I didn’t have money in my own pocket nor did I have a home of my own to go back to in Oslo. I put my pride aside and asked for help from my family and the company I was working for so I could do what I needed to do for myself. I renewed an expired passport. I booked a plane ticket. I made sure I met all requirements necessary to bring my little dog with me. I began shipping the few belongings I had back to Norway. And I prepared my closest friends and extended family there for my departure by asking for their support and understanding of my decision. It was one small step at the time, and each step helped move me forward.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Letting go of what I had then was one of the best decision I have ever made for myself. I gave myself permission to create a better life for myself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A constant during this challenging period of my life was my remote work. It offered the flexibility I needed to relocate and start my next chapter.</p>\n<p>Back in Oslo, I settled into an apartment which my sister helped me find while I still was overseas and had been unable to travel. I took a few weeks off work, still conflicted with what I wanted out of life and worried about what the future would hold for me. During my leave of absence from work I was called upon to lead an onsite kick-off of a significant multisite WordPress migration project with an important client in Canada. In my mind, I was still in need of “me-time” to get my life in order. But I chose to embrace the opportunity to be there for our team and to serve our client together. It would be another life-changing decision. During my visit to Toronto, I met and fell in love with the person who would become my significant other.</p>\n<h3>Steps To Conquer Your Own Obstacles.</h3>\n<h4>Step 1: Commit To Becoming a Better You</h4>\n<p>I’ve learned through my personal and work experiences that nothing holds you back in life more than yourself. Life has taught me that who you aspire to be and what you want to do is within your reach. It’s within you.</p>\n<p>You can start a transformation that lets you move towards a happier, more fulfilling place by making a commitment to consciously and continuously learn and grow yourself.</p>\n<p>Welcome failures because they will provide you with new learning. You have the ability to overcome them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take care to hone skills you have acquired. Develop new skills you aspire to have.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Discover your strengths. Apply them and find ways to develop them further. Your strengths makes up your unique ability, and your unique ability is who you are and why you are here. Use it, it will be your biggest contribution to the world.</p>\n<p>Be your own hero and get out of your own way. When you do, new and often unexpected opportunities are revealed. And you’ll discover that your possibilities in life are limitless.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Find an Encourager</h4>\n<p>When you are ready to start your own journey of transformation, or if you are in the middle of one now, it’s important to find someone who can be your encourager and your ally on that journey.</p>\n<p>Look for someone in your circle of family or friends, or within the community. If don’t have anyone, I would welcome the opportunity to get to know you and cheer you on!</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Let Yourself Be Inspired.</h4>\n<p>Below are the key resources that helped spark my transformation in significant ways, and has lead me to where I am today. They continue to be sources of inspiration, and I hope they can be yours, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Books</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://strengths.gallup.com/110242/about-book.aspx\">Strengths Based Leadership: Great Leaders, Teams, and Why People Follow</a><br />\n(Tom Rath)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://uniqueability.com/\">Unique Ability: Creating the Life You Want</a><br />\n(Dan O&#8217;Sullivan, Catherine Nomura, Shannon Waller &amp; Julia Waller)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amy-wallace.com/creativity-inc/\">Creativity Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration</a><br />\n(Ed Catmull &amp; Amy Wallace)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html\">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap&#8230;And Others Don&#8217;t</a><br />\n(Jim Collins)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.danpontefract.com/the-second-book/\">The Purpose Effect: Building Meaning in Yourself, Your Role and Your Organization</a><br />\n(Dan Pontefract)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thought Leaders, Influencers &amp; Contributors to the Servant Leadership Community</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheryl Bachelder &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CABachelder\">@CABachelder</a> (Popeyes)</li>\n<li>Art Barter &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Art_Barter\">@Art_Barter</a> (Servant leadership Institute)</li>\n<li>Ken Blanchard &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenblanchard\">@kenblanchard</a> (The Ken Blanchard Companies)</li>\n<li>Garry Ridge &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LearningMoment\">@LearningMoment</a> (WD-40)</li>\n<li>Kevin Monroe &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevin_monroe\">@kevin_monroe</a> (X Factor Consulting)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giving Thanks.</h3>\n<p>I’d like to thank Topher DeRosia here at HeroPress for giving me the opportunity to share my story. It is against my nature to talk about myself to this extent, but I do it knowing it can serve others. To write my story, I’ve also had to move past my fear of being in the spotlight and accept there may be judgement passed. The reality is that no one will ever hold me to a higher standard or judge me harder than I do myself.</p>\n<p>A very special thanks goes out to my wife, Heather, who bore with me through the, at times, difficult writing process. She has opened my eyes to life’s possibilities. In her, I found a partner I wanted to journey with. She believes in me and helps me believe in myself, and she is my greatest ally and encourager. As I write these words, I recognize they will be published the week of our 4-year wedding anniversary. Our years together have been the very best of my life so far.</p>\n<p>I also want to offer a heartfelt thank you to another big ally and encourager, my coach and friend Jeff. He’s made me believe in pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows, and I am so grateful for him coming into my life and having him be part of the journey.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to Dave and to the team at XWP.

The online event is organized by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that encourages participants to work towards writing a 50,000-word novel. Writers commit to posting their word counts to their profiles each day during the event, which runs from November 1-30.</p>\n<p>NaNoWriMo began in 1999 in the San Francisco Bay Area with just 21 writers and grew to 5,000 participants the following year, thanks to promotion from bloggers around the web. In 2015, the project had 431,626 participants, including 80,137 students and educators in the Young Writers Program.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Tools for NaNoWriMo</h3>\n<p>The NaNoWriMo website encourages writers to use their own materials for writing their novels, such as a word-processing program, typewriter, pen and paper, or whatever inspires the most creativity. WordPress is ideally suited for capturing your writing and keeping track of your word count. There are also several plugins that make it easy to break novels up into chapters and export your work into the proper formats for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">self publishing with WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nano-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Status</a> is a plugin created specifically for NaNoWriMo participants. Public accountability with word counts is one of the motivating factors for many writers who participate in the event, and Nano Stats makes it easy to display your progress in posts, pages, and sidebar widgets. It pulls in word count stats from the NaNoWriMo website for the username entered in the plugin&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nano-stats.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nano-stats.png?resize=616%2C359&ssl=1\" alt=\"nano-stats\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63393\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mybookprogress/\" target=\"_blank\">MyBookProgress</a> plugin is another option for tracking your novel&#8217;s progress and displaying stats. The plugin&#8217;s writing goals and deadline tracking features are customizable so it can also be used for other projects besides NaNoWriMo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mybookprogress-widget.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mybookprogress-widget.png?resize=283%2C156&ssl=1\" alt=\"mybookprogress-widget\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-63396\" /></a>MyBookProgress allows users to upload cover images for their books and displays a progress bar using a widget or a shortcode. It also includes MailChimp integration so that readers can subscribe to get progress updates on a book.</p>\n<p>In addition to the customizable goal tracking, MyBookProgress comes with preset template for NaNoWriMo participants who are working to achieve the 50,000-word goal. Progress can be recorded directly inside WordPress for display on your own website, as opposed to having to sign into the NaNoWriMo website. The backend of the plugin includes a writing statistics dashboard to give you an idea of which day of the week is your most productive, and your average percentage per day/week/month. Users can easily share their progress to Facebook or Twitter directly from the plugin&#8217;s writing dashboard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MyBookProgress.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MyBookProgress.png?resize=805%2C582&ssl=1\" alt=\"mybookprogress\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63398\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/author-wordcount/\" target=\"_blank\">Author Wordcount</a> is a much simpler plugin that allows writers to display one or multiple works in progress via a widget. Current word count and expected (goal) word count can be entered in the admin on the plugin&#8217;s settings page. It also has a simple UI that fits in more seamlessly with WordPress than the MyBookProgress plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/author-wordcount.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/author-wordcount.png?resize=932%2C1198&ssl=1\" alt=\"author-wordcount\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63404\" /></a></p>\n<p>During the NaNoWriMo event&#8217;s 18-year history, nearly <a href=\"http://nanowrimo.org/published-wrimos\" target=\"_blank\">400 novels have been published</a> via traditional publishing houses. Participants have also self-published more than 200 novels. If you achieve your goal of finishing a novel and want to look into <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">self-publishing</a>, there are many tools that make it easy to export content hosted on both WordPress.com and self-hosted sites.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthologize</a> plugin allows authors to publish their works in several ebook formats, including PDF, EPUB and TEI. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/bookpress-client/\" target=\"_blank\">BookPress Client</a> is another free plugin  that organizes your writing into a custom post type so book posts won’t show up mixed with normal blog posts on your site. It supports both ePub and Kindle mobi formats. WordPress.com users can take advantage of services like <a href=\"http://www.fastpencil.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FastPencil</a> or <a href=\"http://blog2print.sharedbook.com/blogworld/printmyblog/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blog2Print</a> for importing their posts into different book reader and print formats.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Nov 2016 21:03:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Mark Jaquith: The 4 best WordPress hosts of 2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/?p=5235\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/best-wordpress-hosts-in-2016/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6421:\"<p>As a seasoned WordPress developer, I am frequently asked what WordPress web hosts I recommend. There are so many solid choices now! The WordPress ecosystem is truly a bounty of choice in 2016. I could write an exhaustive comparison of all of the options, but these are called &#8220;exhaustive comparisons&#8221; for a reason. Let&#8217;s skip that, and I&#8217;ll just tell you the four WordPress hosts I recommend in five&nbsp;distinct tiers.</p>\n<p>Note that many of these hosts target a range of sites, from starter sites to enterprise sites, so I am picking the hosts that I think fit each tier of site&nbsp;<em>best</em>, even though they might also work for other kinds of sites.</p>\n<h2>Starter Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">SiteGround</a> is one of my favorite WordPress hosting companies. They offer a range of hosting solutions, but their WordPress-tailored plans are a tremendously good value and have many WordPress-specific perks. Ask around the WordPress community — SiteGround&nbsp;is a well-respected company that works hard to win and retain the business of WordPress customers. Their plans start as low as $3.95 a month, which is an incredibly good deal. If you aren&#8217;t sure what you need, SiteGround is what I would choose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">Take a look at SiteGround&#8217;s WordPress hosting plans</a>.</p>\n<h2>Developer-Friendly Site</h2>\n<p>What if you know your way around WordPress, want things like Git and <a href=\"https://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI </a>access, or want advanced WordPress-friendly caching for your site? <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">SiteGround has you covered</a> there, too. Their GoGeek plan (currently $14.95 a month) offers all of these perks, unlimited sites, WordPress staging sites, and so much more. I love working with GoGeek-level SiteGround sites, because they work really well and give me access to all the tools that I need as a developer. Or, if you&#8217;re not a developer, but have hired one to work on your site, you may want to upgrade to GoGeek hosting so she can work at maximum efficiency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">Go sign up for SiteGround&#8217;s GoGeek WordPress hosting</a>.</p>\n<h2>Intermediate&nbsp;Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=917225&u=1391570&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=\">WP Engine</a>&nbsp;has been around since 2010, focuses entirely on WordPress hosting, and has established themself as a solid choice in the intermediate range. Their plans start at $29/month and include a 60-day money-back guarantee and free automated migration of your existing WordPress site. WP Engine&nbsp;also has more advanced hosting options, so they&#8217;re an option that could grow with you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=917225&u=1391570&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=\">Sign up for WP Engine using this link</a> and you&#8217;ll save 20% off your first payment.</p>\n<h2>Professional Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/pricing\">Pantheon</a> got their start as a Drupal host, but have taken their innovative container-based hosting technology to the WordPress market. As a developer, I appreciate their Git-based development flow, their powerful &#8220;Terminus&#8221; command line client, and their built-in and dead-simple dev/test/live environments. On the higher level plans, you get &#8220;Multidev&#8221; which lets you spin up a sandboxed development environment for a specific Git branch. This means you can send clients and testers URLs for testing new features in isolation, before they are merged back into the main code branch. Awesome.</p>\n<p>Their professional tier starts at $100/month, which isn&#8217;t cheap, but your developers will love their deployment tools, their dev/test/live code staging flows, and their Git-based deploys to the development environment. Pantheon is a great choice for professional WordPress sites that have a developer on staff or on retainer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/pricing\">Check out Pantheon&#8217;s professional WordPress hosting plans</a>.</p>\n<h2>Enterprise Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://pagely.7eer.net/c/335029/141222/2787\">Pagely</a> has been around since 2006! They started the whole WordPress-dedicated hosting marketplace. When they started, they targeted a range of WordPress sites, but now they focus on enterprise hosting. This is where big brands go for custom WordPress hosting solutions. The folks at Pagely know WordPress well, and will be an excellent hosting partner for your enterprise WordPress site. Their VPS solutions start at $499/month, but they also have a shared server plan called Neutrino for $99/month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pagely.7eer.net/c/335029/141222/2787\">Get started with Pagely enterprise hosting</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I Picked</h2>\n<p>My method here was simple. I thought about how I answer if a friend or a client asks me for hosting advice. I found that I regarded sites as fitting in one of five categories. Then, I considered which hosts offer the best service and value in those categories, and picked these four hosts. After I had made my picks and written about their benefits, I went to see which of my picks had affiliate programs. Three of them did, and one did not. I used affiliate links for those that offered them, and a direct link for the one that did not. Using affiliate links to sign up for their service will earn me some money, but you can of course just go directly to their sites if you like. I stand by these recommendations, either way. I&#8217;ll write a new post in 2017 with my new picks.

Both messages contained a URL to <a href=\"http://www.baidu.com/\">Baidu</a> with my Skype username at the end. I immediately became suspicious and after a cursory search of Google, I discovered that I <a href=\"https://community.skype.com/t5/Security-Privacy-Trust-and/Link-to-quot-baidu-quot-website-sent-to-all-of-my-contacts/td-p/4461728/page/15\">wasn&#8217;t the only one</a> receiving these messages.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SkypeBaiduLink.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63380\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SkypeBaiduLink.png?resize=378%2C229&ssl=1\" alt=\"Baidu Links in Skype Messages\" /></a>Baidu Links in Skype Messages\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://community.skype.com/t5/Security-Privacy-Trust-and/Spam-messages-amp-links-sent-from-your-account/td-p/4511001\">support document</a> published by Claudius, Community Manager at Skype, the accounts sending the messages are most likely compromised. The document offers a list of steps that includes, checking your computer for malware, changing passwords, and increasing the security of your Skype account.</p>\n<h2>Tips to Strengthen the Security of Your Skype Account</h2>\n<p>Microsoft recently made changes so that Skype, Office, Xbox, and other Microsoft services can be managed with a single account. If you haven&#8217;t <a href=\"https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/one-account-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services\">upgraded your Skype account</a> to a Microsoft account, visit <a href=\"https://account.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft&#8217;s account</a> page and enter your Skype username and password. You&#8217;ll be prompted to upgrade which can only be done once.</p>\n<p>Once upgraded, click on the Security and Privacy settings link. This is where you can change your password, add security information, and enable two-step verification.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TwoStepAuthentication.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63384\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TwoStepAuthentication.png?resize=445%2C171&ssl=1\" alt=\"Two Factor Authentication Enabled\" /></a>Two-Step Verification Enabled\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that in recent years, there have been major data leaks where the login credentials of millions of people have been exposed to the public. If you use the same password on multiple sites, visit <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> and check to see if your password was leaked. If you see the Oh no — pwned! message, you should update your password immediately.</p>\n<h3>Create a New Primary Alias</h3>\n<p>In addition to changing passwords and turning on two-step verification, you should limit the aliases that are allowed to login to your account.

He identified <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/WordPress-Editor-Android\" target=\"_blank\">two</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">repositories</a> that Wix forked in order to bring the GPL-licensed WordPress Rich Text Editor into its app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I were being charitable, I’d say, &#8216;The app’s editor is based on the WordPress mobile app’s editor.&#8217; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If I were being honest, I’d say that Wix copied WordPress without attribution, credit, or following the license.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even though the Wix app is made up of different modules and libraries, the GPL requires that the entire application be GPL-licensed since Wix is distributing the app with GPL code in it. Open sourcing the entire app&#8217;s code under the GPL is the only way to resolve the license violation, according to Mullenweg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your app’s editor is built with stolen code, so your whole app is now in violation of the license,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Some took issue with use of the term &#8220;stolen code&#8221; in connection with public, open source repositories, but the effect is the same regardless of Wix&#8217;s intention. Wix distributed GPL code without respecting its license, putting new limitations on it instead of preserving its freedoms. That code was not legally available to be repurposed without following its license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You’d probably be in the clear if you had used just the original editor we started with (ZSSRichTextEditor, MIT licensed),&#8221; Automattic&#8217;s General Counsel Paul Sieminski commented on the issue. &#8220;Instead, Wix took our version of the editor which has 1000+ original commits on top of the original MIT editor, that took more than a year to write. We improved it. A lot. And Wix took those improvements, used them in their app but then stripped out all of the important rights that they’re not legally allowed to take away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg called for Wix to release its entire mobile app under the GPL, as required by the license, and make the source code available so that others can build on it and learn from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you want to close the door on innovation, Wix, that’s your decision to make — just write your own code,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If you’re going to join the open source community, play by the open source rules.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Wix CEO Responds, Neglects to Address GPL Licensing Issues</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s open letter to Wix took the company by surprise. Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami <a href=\"http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> the next day on the company&#8217;s blog with a tone that imposed an artificial sense of fraternity in order to make the original allegation appear to be an over reaction. &#8220;Wow, dude I did not even know we were fighting,&#8221; Abrahami said. He cited Wix&#8217;s manifold contributions to open source software on the company&#8217;s GitHub account and their admiration of WordPress&#8217; commitment to giving back.</p>\n<p>His artful deflection avoids the licensing issue completely and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the GPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, we did use the WordPress open source library for a minor part of the application (that is the concept of open source right?), and everything we improved there or modified, we submitted back as open source, see here in this <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> – you should check it out, pretty cool way of using it on mobile native. I really think you guys can use it with your app (and it is open source, so you are welcome to use it for free). And, by the way, the part that we used was in fact developed by another and modified by you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GPL compliance, however, requires more than a show of open source spirit. Abrahami did not address the requirement that the entire mobile app be released as GPL but offered a vague statement about sharing code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you need source code that we have, and we have not yet released, then, most likely we will be happy to share, you only need to ask,&#8221; Abrahami said. It is still unclear as to whether his statement means the company will release the entire mobile app under the GPL or not. However, the company indicated on Twitter that they will release the app on GitHub.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yairwein\">@yairwein</a> We\'ll release the code on Github, where we also shared our previous projects: <a href=\"https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn\">https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Wix.com (@Wix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wix/status/792656290854174721\">October 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other option would be for the company to completely remove any GPL code from its app and use the original MIT-licensed library for the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress GPL Rich Text component in question, is actually a wrapper around another Rich Text component named ZSSRichTextEditor which is licensed MIT,&#8221; Wix lead engineer Tal Kol said in the article he <a href=\"https://medium.com/@talkol/how-i-found-myself-accused-of-stealing-code-from-wordpress-a7350da9f9f2#.h5zgf9lnc\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> over the weekend. &#8220;In retrospect it would have been easier to use it directly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Using the original library would stop the current GPL infringement but does not erase the fact that the company has already violated the license by distributing the code.</p>\n<p>Wix has not yet officially announced what it plans to do, but at the time of publishing the company continues to distribute GPL code inside its proprietary app.</p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Is Willing to Go to Court to Protect the GPL</h3>\n<p>According to the GNU.org GPL FAQ, the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhoHasThePower\" target=\"_blank\">copyright holders of the software have the power to enforce the GPL</a>, as the license is a copyright license. Copyright holders are advised to inform developers of the GPL-covered software if they see a violation. With the GPLv2, the only way for license violators to receive back their rights after violation is to <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html\" target=\"_blank\">petition the copyright holder</a>. Mullenweg has already identified a path to compliance for Wix.</p>\n<p>Although many in the open source community are itching for a definitive court case involving the GPL, Mullenweg said his preferred outcome is to see Wix open source its mobile app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would much rather they just release their app as GPL rather than have to get into a legal fight,&#8221; he <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/#comment-586279\" target=\"_blank\">replied</a> to commenters on his blog.</p>\n<p>When I asked if he is willing to take the matter to court if Wix does not comply, Mullenweg said, &#8220;We would of course go to court to protect the GPL.&#8221; He also said that if Wix decides to pursue the other avenue, &#8220;removing the library would fix it going forward, but not for things that already infringed.&#8221; Mullenweg could not say what Automattic will or won&#8217;t do in a legal context regarding the past infringement, as the situation is still developing.</p>\n<p>This weekend&#8217;s debate between Mullenweg and Wix sparked discussions across social media platforms as well as blog post responses about how the the GPL affects the industry. It also shows how divisive the license can be even among open source software proponents. Mullenweg, who is known inside the WordPress community as a zealous defender of the GPL, has demonstrated a willingness to go to battle over <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks\" target=\"_blank\">violations of the license in the past</a>.</p>\n<p>Many in the WordPress and Wix communities took issue with the public handling of the matter, but ultimately the controversy is not a personal matter between Mullenweg and Wix. The proprietary mobile app distributes GPL code that was the work of many contributors. WordPress&#8217; open source code was built from the hard work of people who were willing to give that time and energy because they believe in the project and the freedoms that its license guarantees. Wix&#8217;s disrespect of that license illegally co-opts those contributions for the company&#8217;s closed source app.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;My program will have liberty, or never be born.&#8221;</h3>\n<p>The GPL license is holistic in the sense that all parts of an application are connected &#8211; if one part bears the freedoms of the GPL, the entire app benefits from the GPL and must be therefore be open for all. The GPL is the reason WordPress exists and the reason why Mullenweg is so passionate about it. If b2/cafelog had not been GPL-licensed, Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little would not have been able to <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">build on it</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the questions in the GNU GPL FAQ asks, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatIfSchool\" target=\"_blank\">What if my school might want to make my program into its own proprietary software product?</a>&#8221; This question addresses how many universities try to restrict the use of the knowledge and information they (and their students) develop, a problem that also exists in commercial businesses. The GNU recommendation for developers wanting to ensure their software is allowed to be GPL licensed is to raise the issue at the earliest possible stage for the most leverage:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only half-done, saying, &#8216;If you will agree to releasing this as free software, I will finish it.&#8217; Don&#8217;t think of this as a bluff. To prevail, you must have the courage to say, <strong>&#8216;My program will have liberty, or never be born.&#8217;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This powerful sentiment is one that many GPL software contributors have adopted as a way of life. They contribute code on the basis that it will be passed on with all its freedoms. Taking GPL-licensed code and putting it in a proprietary app is an affront to their contributions.</p>\n<p>Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami&#8217;s casual response identifies both parties as open source proponents who are working to make the web a better place. This response misses the mark because it fails to recognize WordPress&#8217; 13-year history with the GPL and how deeply it has impacted the software&#8217;s trajectory and ability to make the web a better, more open place. This license and WordPress&#8217; commitment to user freedoms has been the project&#8217;s true north from its inception.</p>\n<p>When a project is given the GPL license, it makes that code and the license&#8217;s freedoms inseparable. Essentially, that code isn&#8217;t legally available to anyone without those freedoms in place. Regardless of whether Wix&#8217;s deflection of the issue is motivated by ignorance of the GPL or malicious intent, the company has to answer for its misuse of the software. The ball is now in Wix&#8217;s court &#8211; to comply with what the GPL license requires or take its own interpretation to court.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:23:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Apples TV’s Struggles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46916\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/apples-tvs-struggles/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:983:\"<p><a href=\"http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html\"><img class=\"  wp-image-46924 alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/10/apple-tv.jpg?resize=231%2C201&ssl=1\" alt=\"apple-tv.jpg\" /></a>Joseph Rosensteel has <a href=\"http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html\">an outsider but savvy perspective on the updates and technology around Apple TV</a>.

Wix has always borrowed liberally from WordPress &#8212; including their company name, which used to be Wixpress Ltd. &#8212; but this blatant rip-off and code theft is beyond anything I&#8217;ve seen before from a competitor.</p>\n<h3>Dear Wix,</h3>\n<p>This explicitly contravenes the GPL, which requires attribution and a corresponding GPL license on whatever you release publicly built on top of GPL code. The GPL is what has allowed WordPress to flourish, and that let us create this code. Your app&#8217;s editor is built with stolen code, so your whole app is now in violation of the license.</p>\n<p>I suppose we’ll take this as a compliment &#8212; I’m sure the hundreds of people who have contributed to WordPress Core and our mobile apps are flattered that you chose to build one of your company’s core features using our code. We’re also excited to see what great things you create with all the time you saved not having to write your own mobile editor.</p>\n<p>You know what’d be even more exciting? To see you abide by the GPL and release your source code back to the community that gave you that jump start.</p>\n<p>I’ve always said that <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/\">the GPL isn’t about limits, it’s about possibilities</a>. In open source software, you trade some of your control as a developer to better serve the developer community and the people using your sites and products. I don’t think that’s a limit, I think it’s a way to make sure we encourage innovation and momentum. If you want to close the door on innovation, Wix, that’s your decision to make &#8212; just write your own code. If you’re going to join the open source community, play by the open source rules.</p>\n<p>Release your app under the GPL, and put the source code for your app up on GitHub so that we can all build on it, improve it, and learn from it.</p>\n<p>Love,<br />\nMatt and the open source community</p>\n<h3>An Update</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/\">CEO of Wix has posted a response on their blog</a>. I&#8217;ll also try to post my response it to the comments there. <a href=\"http://wpgarage.com/news-views/weak-wix-response-wordpress-gpl/\">Miriam Schwab also has a very good response</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were all very surprised by your post, as you have so many claims against us.</p>\n<p>Wow, dude I did not even know we were fighting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a fight: the claim is that the Wix mobile apps distribute GPL code and aren&#8217;t themselves GPL, so they violate the license.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, you say we have been taking from the open source community without giving back, well, of course, that isn’t true. Here is a list of 224 projects on our public <a href=\"https://github.com/wix\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub page</a>, and as you can see they are all dated before your post. We have not checked if WordPress is using them, but you are more than welcome to do so, some of them are pretty good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very glad your company has projects on GitHub! Thank you for the offer to use them; if we do, we&#8217;ll make sure to follow the license you&#8217;ve put on the code very carefully.</p>\n<p>Releasing other open source projects doesn&#8217;t mean that you can violate the license of the editor code you distributed in your mobile apps. To repeat my earlier points: since you distributed GPL code with your apps, the entire apps need to be released at GPL, not just your modifications to that one library.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12828814\">this Hacker News comment put it</a>, &#8220;Open source is not a swap meet; you can&#8217;t violate a license if you voluntarily release some other code to make up for it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We always shared and admired your commitment to give back, which is exactly why we have those 224 open source projects, and thousands more bugs/improvements available to the open source community and we will release the app you saw as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you were to release the entire source code of the apps under GPL that would bring you back into compliance with the license you violated. I <em>think</em> you&#8217;re saying you will do that here, but can you clarify? When should we look for the app code to be released, and where? That would resolve this issue completely.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Next, you talk about the Wix App being stolen from WordPress. There are more than 3 million lines of code in the Wix application, notably the hotels/blogs/chat/eCommerce/scheduling/booking is all our code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I said the app includes stolen code. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s 30 lines or 30 million lines: because it includes GPL code and you distributed the app, the entire thing needs to be GPL. If you release the entire app&#8217;s code, as I think you said you would, then that resolves the license violation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, we did use the WordPress open source library for a minor part of the application (that is the concept of open source right?), and everything we improved there or modified, we submitted back as open source, see here in this <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> – you should check it out, pretty cool way of using it on mobile native. I really think you guys can use it with your app (and it is open source, so you are welcome to use it for free). And, by the way, the part that we used was in fact developed by another and modified by you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for admitting you used the code and not trying to hide it. The issue isn&#8217;t the changes you made, it&#8217;s that including the editor means you need to submit the entire app as open source, which you have not yet &#8212; it&#8217;s completely proprietary.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want to read the account from Tal Kol, one of the leading engineers on this project, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@talkol/how-i-found-myself-accused-of-stealing-code-from-wordpress-a7350da9f9f2#.7yyylkagl\" target=\"_blank\">here it is</a>. He was really happy to share his side of the story.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have seen it, and it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@csu/can-you-address-this-point-made-in-matts-post-this-explicitly-contravenes-the-gpl-which-7b6460b5b3e1\">already has a number of good comments on it, including this one</a>: &#8220;Can you address this point made in Matt’s post: &#8216;This explicitly contravenes the GPL, which requires attribution and a corresponding GPL license on whatever you release publicly built on top of GPL code&#8217;.&#8221; It appears you and Tal might share a misunderstanding of how the GPL works &#8212; software licensing can be tricky and many people make honest mistakes. (If you want to get into serious detail, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/#comment-586319\">this comment</a> lays the licensing requirements out clearly.) It is easy to rectify this one: release your apps as open source under the GPL.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, what is this thing about us stealing your branding? Our product was always called Wix and our website Wix.com, we never borrowed from your marketing or brand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sorry for including this distraction; I was referring specifically to the fact that Wix used to go by &#8220;Wixpress.&#8221; You can see this <a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-29IDMU/0x0xS1193125-13-387285/1576789/filing.pdf\">in your Form F-1</a>, and there used to be a support page about this on your site:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46910\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-30-at-3.12.19-AM.png?resize=604%2C94&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Although that is still in Google, the <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/support/html5/ugc/62ae9410-79d0-4198-8ff1-4a37966e1e94/0d1a19e1-c862-44e4-a9d6-bc813f8a9207\">page</a> it links to <a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cu5miENIoLl\">now mysteriously returns a 404 error</a>, which you may want to look into.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In fact, if I remember correctly, until recently the Automattic home page was all about blogs and only recently it has become “websites.” Also, your business model changed to almost exactly the one we had for years. Can it be that you guys are borrowing from us? If so, again, you are welcome to it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic home page</a> has been a series of haiku about our products <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121218130226/http://wordpress.com/\">since 2009</a>, pretty much unchanged &#8212; I think you mean the WordPress.com home page here. WordPress has been used for creating websites, not just blogs, since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/\">our 1.5 release in 2005 added themes and pages</a>. In my <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/10/sotw-2014/\">2014 State of the Word address</a> I talked about how 87% of WordPress sites use it as a CMS. We regularly test dozens of variations of the WP.com homepage and some of them definitely emphasize website creation. I will say we look to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace as innovators in the space with products that reach many small businesses, and Wix especially should be commended for its success and growth as a public company.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you believe that we need to give you credit, that you deserve credit, I must say, absolutely yes. You guys deserve a lot of credit, but not because of a few lines of source code, you deserve credit because you guys have been making the internet dramatically better, and for that we at Wix are big fans. We love what you have been trying to do, and are working very hard to add our own contribution to make the internet better.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you very much, that is kind. I do think there are a lot of values we share in common and would love to see this one issue resolved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you need source code that we have, and we have not yet released, then, most likely we will be happy to share, you only need to ask. We share your belief that making the internet better, is best for everyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s what my post was asking, for you to release the code. To quote my original letter: &#8220;Release your app under the GPL, and put the source code for your app up on GitHub so that we can all build on it, improve it, and learn from it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finally, during the last couple of years, I reached out a couple of times trying to meet with you. Could I do that again here? I believe in friendly competition, and as much fun as it is to chat over the blogosphere, maybe we can also do it over a cup of coffee?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once this is resolved I&#8217;d be happy to meet up. I believe when we exchanged emails in 2014 there was trouble finding overlap in our travel schedules.</p>\n<p>I hope the above clarifies where we think Wix made a mistake, and how to fix it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 19:45:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Kanye McDonald’s Poem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46881\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/kanye-mcdonalds-poem/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:302:\"<p>You might need a reason to smile today.

The team has since <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/\">implemented</a> some of the suggestions outlined in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27159\">ticket #27159</a> into WordPress 4.7, including rearranging some of the toolbar buttons. The headers drop-down menu is now in the top row of buttons while the strikethrough and horizontal rule buttons are on the second row.</p>\n<p>The underline and justify buttons are no longer available. According to Andrew Ozz, who primarily works on the TinyMCE editor in WordPress, underlining text causes confusion as readers may interpret it as a link. The justify button was removed because it has uneven browser implementation and often makes text less readable. However, keyboard shortcuts for both buttons will continue to work in 4.7.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WP46FreshInstallPostEditor.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-60457\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WP46FreshInstallPostEditor.png?resize=573%2C396&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 4.6 Post Editor\" /></a>WordPress 4.6 Post Editor\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WordPress47PostEditor.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WordPress47PostEditor.png?resize=637%2C248&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 4.7 Post Editor\" /></a>WordPress 4.7 Post Editor\n<p>In addition to these changes, tooltips that appear when hovering over a button will display the keyboard shortcut making them easier to discover.</p>\n<p>Since WordPress does not track which buttons are used most often the team can not accurately measure the impact these changes will have.

Core contributors are asking for testing and feedback on some of the larger items ahead of the official release, slated for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/\" target=\"_blank\">December 6</a>.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen and its support for atmospheric videos is one of the major front-facing features in 4.7 that could use testing. Last week, when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-default-theme-twenty-seventeen-merged-into-4-7\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Seventeen was merged</a>, there was some uncertainty as to whether or not the first version would ship with video headers. Contributors knuckled down and worked quickly to get basic <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38172\" target=\"_blank\">core support for video headers</a> ready for an initial commit.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen will be the first WordPress theme to use the new feature. Users will be able to manage video headers in the customizer by selecting a video via the media library or setting a URL to an external video, such as one hosted on YouTube. Theme authors who want to add support for videos will be able to do so by passing &#8216;video&#8217; => true as an argument when adding theme support for custom headers. If the browser is unable to play the video, it will fallback to the header image.</p>\n<p>Other user-facing features that require testing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New site setup flow</li>\n<li>Custom CSS with live previews</li>\n<li>User admin languages</li>\n<li>PDF thumbnail previews</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí also requested that plugin and theme developers test the REST API content endpoints, any plugins that might be impacted by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/\" target=\"_blank\">WP_Hook overhaul</a>, the expanded Settings Registration API, custom bulk actions, post type templates, and a few other items.</p>\n<p>With the impressive list of features on deck for 4.7, it&#8217;s only fitting that Beta 1 was accompanied by an extended five-stanza haiku.

For years developers have coveted that same functionality for other post types. In fact, a plugin that attempted to create this functionality (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-template/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Post Template</a>), has more than 50,000 active installs, despite not having been updated for four years.</p>\n<p>Post type templates follow a format similar to that of the existing custom page templates. The author can specify a template name as well as the post types where the template will be available as a dropdown in the page attributes metabox. The current implementation of post type templates can be used with any post type without having to register support for page-attributes. The metabox will be displayed if at least one template exists for a post type.</p>\n<p><code>/*<br />\n * Template Name: Foggy Memories<br />\n * Template Post Type: memory, event<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18375\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for the feature, which was opened four years ago, includes many potential use cases. One developer was building a project involving landing pages that were set up as custom post types. He needed to have multiple templates for the landing pages but had to create a work around since post type templates were not yet available.</p>\n<p>Another developer wanted to make a distinction between posts with guest contributors versus those coming from regular writers, such as displaying author boxes and avatars. Since this project was for a client, an implementation involving post templates would make it easy to assign the different designs via the dropdown in the post attributes metabox.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By opening up the page template functionality to all post types, we continue to improve the template hierarchy&#8217;s flexibility,&#8221; WordPress core committer Pascal Birchler said in his commit message. This new feature opens up many new avenues of customization for theme developers who want to offer alternative layouts and designs for posts. It also makes it easy to include multiple designs (inside a theme) for specific custom post types that a theme will support.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 04:35:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4535\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6878:\"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.7, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/\">December 6</a>, but we need your help to get there. We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> &#8211; From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you&#8217;re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it&#8217;s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We&#8217;ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> &#8211; Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won&#8217;t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>User admin languages</strong> &#8211; Just because your site is in one language doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you&#8217;ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>\n<li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> &#8211; Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> &#8211; If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them?

After <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-to-launch-in-indonesia-zimbabwe-and-columbia\">receiving 182 applications</a>, the three cities selected for the program were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Denpasar, Indonesia</li>\n<li>Harare, Zimbabwe</li>\n<li>Medellín, Colombia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Medellín</a> is scheduled for November 5th and is the first of the three incubator events to take place. Andrea Middleton, Community Organizer for the WordPress open source project, is part of the organizing team and says organizing a camp from the other side of the world is challenging.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The local community is still quite loose/unstructured and there isn&#8217;t a very well-established group of local leaders, so it&#8217;s been an interesting exercise in finding local organizers, speakers, and volunteers,&#8221; Middleton told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>The organizing team consists of a U.S. expatriate who recently moved to the area, a Colombian who now lives in Spain, three locals, two members of the WordCamp Lima team who are lending their experience, and Middleton.</p>\n<p>Spanish is the primary language in Medellín which can present communication challenges. I asked Middleton if she needs to use a translator to communicate to the team, &#8220;I lived in Mexico for 5 years back in the 90s so my Spanish is passable, but it&#8217;s a pretty bilingual group,&#8221; Middleton said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last meeting was in English but most of our text interaction is in Spanish to accommodate the Colombians who are not proficient in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I ask native Spanish speakers to review and or correct my written Spanish when I&#8217;m publishing content to the site. I&#8217;m the primary venue contact and all of that has been in Spanish over email.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Middleton, WhatsApp is huge in Colombia but is not ideal for collaborating with members of WordCamp Central since the team uses Slack. So half of the communication is on WhatsApp while the other is conducted on a free Slack instance.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Medellín&#8217;s <a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/programa/\">schedule</a> includes sessions by local entrepreneurs on how to contribute to WordPress, Multilingual WordPress, and SEO. The opening session features a 15 year-old speaker.</p>\n<p>Thanks to considerable effort on the part of Middleton, the event has a female speaker, &#8220;We had no female speaker applicants, so I poured over the list of women who had attended the meetups and then researched them and recruited them to speak,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;It only ended up with one local female speaker, but I think she&#8217;s going to be great.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Middleton says that when the event concludes, she&#8217;ll publish a post detailing the things she&#8217;s learned organizing a WordCamp from abroad. Tickets are <a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/registro/\">still on sale</a> for <a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Medellín</a> at $10 each and includes lunch and a shirt.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Middleton&#8217;s role in WordCamps and the incubator program, listen to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-234-all-things-wordcamp-with-andrea-middleton\">episode 234</a> of WordPress Weekly.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:11:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: Controversy Surrounding WordPress.org “Popular” Themes Exposes Weaknesses in the Algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63129\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/controversy-surrounding-wordpress-org-popular-themes-exposes-weaknesses-in-the-algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10973:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chart.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chart.jpg?resize=1025%2C511&ssl=1\" alt=\"photo credit:  Luis Llerena\" class=\"size-full wp-image-46313\" /></a>photo credit:  <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/S3JE5YAMND\">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> identifies and ranks the themes that display under the popular tab, you might be surprised to learn that it has nothing to do with ratings. Popularity is a somewhat subjective quality to measure in the first place, but WordPress.org has an algorithm in place to give users an idea of which themes are trending.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/theme-directory-popular-tab.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/theme-directory-popular-tab.png?resize=1025%2C775&ssl=1\" alt=\"theme-directory-popular-tab\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63133\" /></a></p>\n<p>The number of sites using a theme is the first metric that comes to mind for popularity, but it cannot be limited to that or else the results might be skewed towards older themes that are not in fact popular anymore. Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, in response to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/791009700171087872\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a> about how themes appear to be gaming the system, created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFscqBOiOY&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> to explain how the popularity algorithm works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Popular is currently active installs divided by age of the theme and a few other factors,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;Ratings don&#8217;t currently factor into it. We&#8217;re trying to work out an algorithm to add ratings to it. For the most part it&#8217;s a popularity thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked him for more clarification on the other factors and he said it varies depending on what data they have and how that data looks over time. &#8220;We adjust it to have it change fairly regularly, but still reflecting what is popular at the time,&#8221; Wood said.</p>\n<p>Dion Hulse, who also helps maintain WordPress.org infrastructure, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not published by design, to hopefully prevent authors gaming it too much. Other than what Otto has said, they only other public part of it is that a theme must be at least two weeks old to be included in the popular rankings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the end of last year, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-replaces-download-counts-with-the-number-of-active-installs\" target=\"_blank\">theme download counts were replaced with the number of active installs</a> to try to prevent theme authors from gaming the system in order to appear on the Popular tab. Gaming the system is much more difficult now but there are other ways to do it, due to the imperfect measurements for active installs.</p>\n<h3>How WordPress.org Measures Active Installs for Themes</h3>\n<p>The topic of active installs was re-ignited yesterday by Matt Medeiros, a small business owner and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/slocumstudio/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org theme author</a>, who suspected the author of a recently popular theme of gaming the system.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gaming .org theme downloads/active is running rampant. This theme “already has 10k active installs.” DL count roughly 3k <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42\">@Otto42</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aaYwWcsvu8\">pic.twitter.com/aaYwWcsvu8</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Medeiros (@mattmedeiros) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/790940338030608384\">October 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/vertex/\" target=\"_blank\">Vertex</a> theme, new to the directory this month, already has more than 10,000 active installs, despite having a much lower download count and no ratings. Medeiros made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XACFOft1hA\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> explaining what he perceived as suspicious activity propelling it to the fourth most popular spot on WordPress.org. This prompted Samuel Wood to film a response, which breaks down some of the flaws in the system that measures active installs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The active install count is a count of sites that have reported to us that they are checking for an update for that theme and that it is active,&#8221; Wood said. He explained that the 10,000+ in this instance and in many others is a rough estimate because WordPress.org does not have an exact measurement of how many sites have installed a theme:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What we are actually counting is yes, the number of active installs of a theme named Vertex. That may include themes not in our directory, such as this one from Elegant themes. If the theme isn&#8217;t in our directory we still get reports about it. The only way for us to not do that is to have the theme itself that theme check them for updates instead of checking us for updates, which their theme should indeed do. I would go so far as to say that any commercial theme should indeed be checking their commercial site, their systems not ours, but if they don&#8217;t have any special code to handle that case, then yes it will report back to our API server looking for updates. And if it has the name Vertex then yes, it&#8217;s going to be counted as being the Vertex theme. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In this instance, the creators of the Vertex theme were made aware that the name was already in use outside of WordPress.org. They <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30317\" target=\"_blank\">offered to change the name of the theme</a> to iVertex during the review process, but the Theme Review Team decided that it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no gaming going on behind that,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;If somebody does game the system, I will find it. I guarantee you. However, this is not such a case. Our current algorithm looks at active installs and if you happen to pick a name that is very popular [outside of WordPress.org], you can have a large number of active installs without it actually being this theme that is being counted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This problem could be solved with a unique ID for themes. Wood said there is a six-year-old core ticket that he would like to implement, but it&#8217;s not currently a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there is no real push to do that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At some point in the future, I would like all themes and plugins in the WordPress directory to get a unique ID which they can put in their headers and when they report back, having that unique ID will uniquely identify that theme or plugin. It would eliminate so many problems for me. It would make updates so much easier. I would be able to do a whole lot of useful things with it and it would let me fix this problem right here.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How the Popular Themes Algorithm Affects Theme Businesses</h3>\n<p>Getting unique IDs in place is no easy fix, as theme reporting would need to be overhauled and multiple systems that interact with each other would need to be changed. It would be worth it in the long run for more accurate reporting on WordPress.org, which is the first place many users browse when looking for a new theme. If the active install counts are not a proper representation of installations via WordPress.org, then it doesn&#8217;t make sense to pin the popular algorithm to that number.</p>\n<p>I asked Matt Medeiros why he chose to highlight the situation with Vertex, and he explained why many small business owners have a strong interest in the popular themes page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s getting harder and harder to survive as a theme shop these days,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Indie authors are overshadowed by huge theme shops and mega marketplaces. For me, .org is the only source of distribution for my themes, and I have a  desire to see the repo become the defacto place to find quality themes. Sadly, not all themes are submitted to &#8216;do it right&#8217; and many crop up to make a quick cash grab from unsuspecting end-users. Top spots are worth A LOT of money (see: Zerif) and coupled with an aging search engine for themes, gaming to the top is worth it, even in the short term. Unsuspecting users, who find searching too challenging, settle with what’s in front of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medeiros referenced Zerif Lite, which was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-suspended-from-wordpress-theme-directory-300k-users-left-without-updates\" target=\"_blank\">removed from WordPress.org</a>, due to violations of guidelines that began to be enforced after the theme was approved. The theme was pulling in tens of thousands of dollars for ThemeIsle, thanks to its frequent spot among the most popular themes on WordPress.org. Ionut Neagu, the company&#8217;s CEO, estimates that Zerif Lite&#8217;s suspension from the directory will diminish the company’s $70K/month revenue by 50%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There’s a lingering distaste in the review process for freemium upsells,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Not everyone agrees that folks should have an upsell product here, and that’s unfortunate. As a small business owner, that revenue helps me reinvest into the WordPress community, WordCamps, hire and train people in developing with WordPress. At times the review process, mixed with the emotions of others, feels like a rising tax against the small software business owner, like myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When drawing attention to the suspicious active install numbers for the Vertex theme and the flaws in the algorithm, Medeiros drew resistance from Wood, who does not see the directory as a place where businesses should expect a return for their investments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The theme directory is not an advertisement to peddle your wares,&#8221; Wood <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42/status/790999917451808768\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;It is exactly that sort of thinking [that] makes me want to ban all themes with a &#8216;paid&#8217; version from the directory entirely. The theme directory is not an advertising means. That is not its purpose. If that is your intent, then you are doing it wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medeiros said he isn&#8217;t interested in reviewing all themes for possible fraud, nor does he expect Otto to do the same. Vertex is just one example among many where the flaws in the algorithm are on public display.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I chose to highlight this issue because I think the repo can be a better choice for users than a for-profit marketplace,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Either way, I can only hope unearthing this conversation helps affect change for the better.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:16:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"HeroPress: I fell.

I did not grow up without, or learning to cope with an illness or disability. I am not a minority, nor do I belong to a marginalized class. I am a white, American male whom many would say lives a charmed life.</p>\n<p>I do not dispute that.</p>\n<p>However, that does not mean I have not faced adversity. My story is one of finding my own way &#8212; through trial and error, fierce independence, hard work, and lots and lots of ups and downs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was the kid who never knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I realized at an early age that I *could* do whatever I wanted to do; I also learned there was a huge difference between being able to do something and wanting or enjoying to do something.</p>\n<p>I was a pretty good all-around student &#8212; math, science, English and so forth &#8212; and was pushed toward pursuing a career with a big, important title like surgeon or attorney or chemist. I never had an interest in any of that &#8212; I couldn’t see myself going to school for years and years (and taking on even more debt than my four-year degree put me in) just because someone else thought I should.</p>\n<p>Plus, the idea of “corporate America” never really appealed to me. Fighting the rat race every day to get to work in a skyscraper or suburban office complex, toiling away in a cubicle for eight hours, fighting the rat race to get home only to get up and do it all over again the next day. There must be something more.</p>\n<p>I always wanted to be one of those people that woke up every day excited to go to work. I just never knew what that job should be.</p>\n<h3>Growing up in a digital world</h3>\n<p>My parents were elementary-school teachers so we always had access to the school computer (Literally, there was one. This was 1983 in rural Wisconsin!). When I reached high school, we had a shiny new Macintosh at home and it could dial into this thing called “The Internet.”</p>\n<p>I chose to attend <a href=\"http://www.drake.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Drake University</a> in part because it offered an Internet-connected PowerMac in every dorm room. (I cannot overstate how revolutionary this was in the early and mid 1990s!). I majored in Broadcast Journalism, enjoyed it and went on to work in the news media for a couple years, but it took all of a few weeks on campus to because completely enamored with HTML and early iterations of CSS.</p>\n<p>I cobbled together a simple personal homepage using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\" target=\"_blank\">Geocities</a>, and when I got bored of posting personal tidbits surrounded by animated GIFs, turned to creating subpages for bands I liked. That morphed into creating a site dedicated to the Des Moines music scene. That site became pretty popular, mostly because it was 1998 and very few bands had their own website, much less one that looked professional and was updated regularly.</p>\n<p>I found that web designers were few and far between in those years, and was able to create small sites on the side for various businesses, groups and organizations as a way to make beer money. However the web was still very much like the Wild West and there was not a clear career path at that time for aspiring web designers, other than moving to Silicon Valley. I decided to pass and concentrate on completing my degree.</p>\n<h3>The years pass</h3>\n<p>Fast-forward about 10 years to 2012. I turned 35, and that milestone culminated in me quitting a job that I absolutely despised, not because of the job itself but because of the absolute tyrant of a “boss.”</p>\n<p>I had never walked away from employment in my adult life without knowing my next move. But this time it was necessary.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every day I had to sit there I became more and more miserable to the point that it was affecting my marriage and mental health.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily I had built a great personal and professional network and various job opportunities soon presented themselves. I began to think hard about finding a career rather than a mere job &#8212; something I could build upon and grow within. It’s what we all dream, but it seems that few achieve. I was determined to beat those odds.</p>\n<p>A close friend had recently left a communications position at a large utility about 40 miles from where I live, in a larger city with ample professional opportunity. I had always resisted looking for employment in that community, only because of the time it would take each day traveling to/from work. But, this was a very good-paying job that had essentially landed in my lap. My friend gave the workplace rave reviews, so everything seemed to be falling into place.</p>\n<p>I went through the whole rigmarole, interviewing several times with different people. Things were going well. It got to the point that on Friday, June 15, 2012, I received a call from the man whom would be my boss, letting me know that the field had been narrowed to me and one other person. He said as much as he was legally able, and reading through the lines, the job was mine. All I had to do was clear one final hurdle upon my return to Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>For the first time in months, I could see the future unfolding and it felt good.</p>\n<p>While my new “career” was not what I had expected to find I was perfectly content in my decisions. As I walked around Huntington Beach, CA that afternoon the cloudy skies gave way to beautiful, warm sunshine. I thought it was a sign that everything was going to be OK. I had no idea what was next.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/L-73JpAzyo/\" target=\"_blank\">A photo posted by Eric  Kuznacic (@kuznacic)</a> on Jun 17, 2012 at 10:28am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>My hospital bracelet, one of the first things I recall seeing upon waking up from surgery</em></p>\n<h3>The Fall</h3>\n<p>I awoke the morning of June 16, 2012, with the intention of walking along the Pacific Ocean from La Jolla to Ocean Beach, CA. Once there my wife would pick me up after her meetings were over, marking the beginning of a few days of much-needed vacation time before heading home.</p>\n<p>I had spent hours carefully mapping out my route, creating a personal Google Map with all the places I wanted to stop for rest, a bite to eat and so forth, as well as where I could cut down side streets to/from the beach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought I had it all planned out so well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I set out from our hotel, which sits on a bluff high above the Pacific Ocean and abuts two world-caliber golf courses. Google Earth had shown me a route of how to get across the golf course and to a path that would lead me down to the beach below. All I had to do was hop a fence and I was home-free.</p>\n<p>Once over the fence I made a fateful decision to not follow my planned route, which would have taken me to a set of stairs that led to the beach. Instead I believed I had found a “shortcut” that would take me to the beach much more quickly and directly than my mapped route.</p>\n<p>Little did I know that this was what I later was told the locals refer to as a “false path.” I carefully made my way down the cliff, slipping a few times due to the loose gravel and the fact that I was wearing slip-on shoes &#8212; not the best choice for a steep hike. Undeterred, I continued down this path until I came to a spot where going back up was not an option (due to the cliff giving way), and going down further would definitely mean taking a tumble of some sort.</p>\n<p>My head swirled. What was I to do? Should I call 911? No, that would mean I’d have to admit I made a mistake and, I reckoned with myself, health insurance doesn’t pay for a cliffside rescue if there are no injuries. I tried and tried to climb back up, to no avail, until my clothes were completely drenched with sweat.</p>\n<p>Sensing futility, I sat down to rest. That 10 or so minutes gave me a lot to think about. People always ask me if death was on my mind. I can honestly say that thought never once crossed my mind. I began trying to rationalize one of the few choices I had: To jump to a point where I could safely slide down a ways on my butt, allowing me to continue down the cliff. What’s the worst that can happen, I thought; a broken arm and some scrapes.</p>\n<p>I decided this was my only choice and spent a few minutes pumping myself up. The plan was to launch myself from where I was stuck, trying to reach a rock that stuck out of the cliff, perhaps 6-8 feet away. If I could just grab onto that rock, I could gather myself before letting go in an attempt to let gravity do its thing. I snapped a couple photos of where I was at, just in case no one believed what was shaping up to be quite the story.</p>\n<p>I am not a religious man, but I said a silent prayer and went for it. I jumped as far as I could, getting my hands on the intended target rock, only to feel my fingers slip off. Down I went.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All I remember was smacking my face on the cliffside, then free-falling for what felt like an eternity, followed by a slide even further down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I never lost consciousness, and when I came to a rest I was somehow able to adjust my body so that I was sitting up straight, faced with the most picturesque Pacific Ocean view imaginable.</p>\n<p>I screamed for help for a minute or two before realizing it was hopeless. I was still fairly high above the beach, it was windy, the waves were crashing against the shore, and there was no one directly below. It quickly became apparent that if I were to survive, it was up to me and only me.</p>\n<p>Upon gathering myself enough to realize the situation and that my injuries were very severe, my first fear was that I was paralyzed. My right leg was crumpled below me in a way that defies explanation and at first I could not feel it. My right shoe had slipped off in the fall, so I grabbed my right heel and found that there was feeling. That calmed me enough to be able to fish my phone out of my left pocket, something I could not have done had it been in my right pocket.</p>\n<p>I called 911 for the first time in my life. People from San Diego later told me that I should not have had reception in that spot, and sure enough when I later checked, the service map was white (no service) where I was. Miraculously the call went through and I spent the next 26 minutes on the phone with the operator. Luckily I knew right where I was and a lifeguard on a Waverunner was able to locate me and signal to others where I was at.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eric-kuznacic-fall-aftermath.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1450\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eric-kuznacic-fall-aftermath.jpg\" alt=\"This is how I looked the morning after my accident\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a>This is how I looked the morning after my accident\n<p>My right femur has been broken into three pieces. My right orbital bone was shattered &#8212; much like a windshield after being hit by a rock &#8212; as a result of my face slamming against the rocks. I was bleeding profusely from above my right eye and had serious scrapes and abrasions below the waist from sliding down the cliff after a free fall.</p>\n<p>At this point the adrenaline was pumping pretty good, but once my rescuers arrived I started to go into shock. They gave me a shot to counteract those effects, and I was able to tell them to call my wife to let her know I was OK. I still did not realize the extent of my injuries.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought I would be going to the ER and would be released later that day. I was wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I spent the next three-and-a-half days in the hospital, followed by another day in a hotel awaiting our flight home to Wisconsin. Even though I was full of painkillers I was in more pain than I could ever have imagined.</p>\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\n<p>If you’ve read this far you might be wondering what this all has to do with WordPress. Needless to say, faced with a long recovery and unable to drive, I didn’t get that job with the utility.</p>\n<p>Once at home I was couch-bound for nearly four months as my leg slowly healed. I’ve never been a huge movie fan and one can only watch so much TV before becoming very bored. I convinced my wife that I needed a new laptop to pass the time.</p>\n<p>Two years earlier I had been introduced to WordPress via a non-profit organization whose board of directors I joined. They needed someone to keep their website up-to-date, and it just so happened they recently had converted it to WordPress. At that time I did not view WordPress as an avenue toward personal and professional freedom and satisfaction, but it certainly was easier than writing code by hand and scored points for being a handy and easy-to-understand tool.</p>\n<p>I have always been a fan and supporter of open-source software, and how digital collaboration has helped shape the Internet and world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As I lay on that couch and as the summer days passed, I read up on WordPress. The more I read, the more it intrigued me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I learned there was a thriving WordPress community of like-minded individuals, entrepreneurs and others making a living, and while I may not have known anyone locally, advice and assistance was readily available online.</p>\n<p>I dove in head-first, initially because I needed something to help pass the time during my recovery. As I learned and experimented, I came to view WordPress and website development as something that I could once again do to earn a little bit of money and help pay the bills.</p>\n<p>I had a pretty good local network due to my community volunteerism, and soon found a mid-size nonprofit organization who needed help maintaining its current website. That site was built upon some sort of proprietary CMS that did not work anywhere near as well as WordPress. After a few months, talk turned to building a new site and I strongly advocated for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It worked, and the rest, as they say, is history. I am not saying that the journey was an easy one; developing that first site was filled with missteps, mistakes and things I had to re-do several times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I was learning, I was independent, and I was making the best out of sitting on the couch 90 percent of the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That first project turned out well enough to impress the organization, and led them to suggest my services to others. Soon I had a handful of clients who turned to me because they had heard of this tool called WordPress but needed an “expert” to guide them. This led me to believe that this was a sustainable business, and perhaps could be the career that I had sought for so long.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ic0Qexgz91/\" target=\"_blank\">Always good to be in #oceanbeach #sandiego</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Eric  Kuznacic (@kuznacic) on Dec 27, 2013 at 7:29pm PST</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>How I feel every day when I wake up and realize I am my own boss</em></p>\n<h3>What WordPress means to me</h3>\n<p>I love everything about WordPress, but also realize that I am nowhere close to mastering this wonderful tool. I think that is what drives me to get up every morning &#8212; the chance to learn something new, to solve a problem, to seek out solutions, to expand my skill set for future projects. And, most importantly, WordPress provides me a vehicle through which I am able to set my own course, be my own boss, and build things my own way.</p>\n<p>I love the WordPress community and all those whom I have met or interacted. You are some very, very smart people! I relish the chance to extend my interest in volunteerism to the WordPress community, giving back to those who are just learning. I have attended WordCamps near and far, and in January 2016 founded a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Janesville-Area-WordPress-Users\" target=\"_blank\">local WordPress Meetup group</a> in the city where I live. I also spent three semesters teaching &#8220;WordPress 101&#8221; at the local technical college. These experiences, all because of WordPress, introduced me to others locally who share my love of WordPress.</p>\n<p>I officially launched <a href=\"https://www.wtftechsolutions.com\" target=\"_blank\">Why The Fuss? Technical Solutions</a>, my one-man design and development shop, on June 1, 2013, just two weeks shy of the one-year anniversary of my accident. I have been asked why I did not wait until June 16 to launch as a symbolic date. I have never before really told anyone why.</p>\n<p>The doctors told me it would be a full 12 months before I was fully back up on my feet. I viewed launching my business as a way to prove to myself that while time frame was accurate, on June 16, 2013 I wanted to be able to look back at what the previous year had laid bare for me with a positive outlook toward the future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am well aware of the fact that I do not know everything there is to know, about WordPress or life in general. But this excites me and drives me to do more.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the past this type of situation would have driven me crazy, as I did not have such a heavy investment in whatever I was doing; it was just a job.</p>\n<p>WordPress has helped me find a career, one I never would have found if not for a series of unfortunate events and fateful decisions. I look forward to continuing this journey of personal and professional fulfillment.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I fell.

Weglot was originally a simple JavaScript project that offered a language switcher so that users could view websites in different languages. After testers started asking for a solution that could be used with WordPress without causing SEO problems, Weglot co-founders scrapped the JavaScript idea and put all their energies towards creating a WordPress plugin that would follow best practices.</p>\n<p>Berda, the engineer who built the plugin, said he developed it from a &#8220;non-WordPress&#8221; point of view and the team was excited when they started getting one person a day downloading the plugin. They jumped into the WordPress market sight unseen, with no contacts and very little understanding of the community.</p>\n<p>In February 2016, after finishing out the previous month with 291€ in revenue, Weglot co-founders officially launched their <a href=\"https://weglot.com/pricingwp\" target=\"_blank\">SaaS-based commercial offerings</a> to extend the capabilities of the free WordPress.org plugin. They brought the plugin out of beta and decided to sponsor and attend WordCamp Paris to connect with the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress was just a name that we had heard of but didn’t know anything about it,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;Sponsoring the WordCamp was without a doubt what really launched us. Within two days, we had met and exchanged with many people from the WordPress community. After the WordCamp, we started to get more and more users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Berda what surprised him about WordPress and its commercial ecosystem as someone who was brand new to the community in 2015. He said they knew coming into it that many websites were built on the software but couldn&#8217;t imagine the size or the strength of the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t imagine that WordPress was so &#8216;community&#8217; based,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;Events, meetups, WordCamps (in so many cities), blogs, and even a French Slack group.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Berda said he and his co-founder were also surprised by how infrequently the SaaS model is used in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People were reluctant to use a SaaS approach at first &#8211; they prefer to buy a piece a software even if it means no support,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;It was surprising to us because outside WordPress, SaaS has surpassed the &#8216;software&#8217; approach for many reasons. The good thing we&#8217;ve seen is that it changed rapidly between the end of last year and today. It seems the SaaS approach we have is no longer a problem for our users as they understand the value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In July 2016, Weglot passed €3,500 in monthly revenue, which enabled the team to rent a small office where they could be fully dedicated to the project. Prot and Berda have added a customer support specialist and Weglot&#8217;s monthly recurring revenue is on a steady uphill climb. Last week the plugin <a href=\"http://blog.weglot.com/0-7000euromonthly-beginning-journey/\" target=\"_blank\">passed 5,000 active installs</a> and Berda said they passed 10,000€ per month in actual revenue (7,000€/month in recurring revenue).</p>\n<p>Weglot now has paying customers in 75 countries and Berda gave us a break down of their top seven in terms of MRR (Monthly Recurring revenue):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>France : 20%</li>\n<li>USA : 13%</li>\n<li>UK  : 6.4%</li>\n<li>Spain : 6.3%</li>\n<li>Germany : 4.4%</li>\n<li>Canada : 3.5%</li>\n<li>Italy : 3.4%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As Weglot&#8217;s founders are French, it isn&#8217;t surprising the product has taken off in France. Over the past few years <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-paris-2014-uniting-the-french-wordpress-community\" target=\"_blank\">the French WordPress community has become more united and connected</a> with WordPress-related events expanding into other cities beyond Paris. The challenges of multilingual publishing is an important topic at these events and other WordCamps around Europe, and Weglot seems to be solving some of these problems for users.</p>\n<p>Compared to more established competitors in the multilingual plugin space, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/\" target=\"_blank\">Polylang</a> (with 200,000+ active installs) and the 100% commercial <a href=\"https://wpml.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WPML</a> plugin, which boasts a 40-person team, Weglot is still considered a small player. Berda said they hope to distinguish the plugin from its competitors by providing a quicker, simpler setup, a clean approach for SEO, and broader compatibility with WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weglot has a technical approach that is really different from other plugins,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;For translated pages, Weglot lets WordPress build the webpage normally and hooks at the end of the code to translate the content. By doing so, Weglot works on a HTML page, making its content source-agnostic and thus solving many compatibility problems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin also uses rewrite rules to create different URLs for each language offered on the site. For example, <strong>mywebsite.com/contact</strong> returns a page in English, <strong>mywebsite.com/fr/contact</strong> displays the French version, and <strong>mywebsite.com/es/contact</strong> returns the page in Spanish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This approach combined with adding tags &#8216;alternate&#8217; hreflang in the page, means that Weglot meets <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182192?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">SEO best practices recommended by Google</a>,&#8221; Berda said.</p>\n<p>Apart from finding the right technical approach, Berda said one of the biggest challenges has been maintaining a high level of support. His team has committed to supporting both free and paying customers through forums and live chat. Over the next six months Weglot is aiming to grow its revenue to €20,000/ month, expand its support team, and establish its SaaS approach as a viable business model in the WordPress multilingual plugin space.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 19:56:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: WordPress and Web Development Communities Get Together to Help Non-Profits at Website Weekend LA\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63108\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-and-web-development-communities-get-together-to-help-non-profits-at-website-weekend-la\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3114:\"<p>This past weekend, people from the web development and WordPress communities <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-take-center-stage-during-website-weekend-los-angeles-oct-22-23\">gathered in Los Angeles</a> to attend <a href=\"http://websiteweekend.la/\">Website Weekend LA</a>.

The team also performed optimizations to speed up the site and reworked the donation page to improve its flow.</p>\n<p>Although the event was geared towards non-profits, Sivan says the teams benefited by sharing knowledge with each other, &#8220;I talked to many lead developers through the weekend, and some non-lead,&#8221; Sivan said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While the non-profits were the main focus for the weekend, we were clearly all there to help them, many developers got a good tutorial or two in advanced coding especially on a team. Ryan on our team helped Kelly setup DesktopServer, and we both taught them how to use GIT for versioning, SASS and finally gulp for processing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I even got a chance to bestow some AngularJS knowledge since the map and search results sidebar on the map were an AngularJS application powered by custom routes and endpoints of the WordPress REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sivan says he was astonished by the amount of people in the community that came together to volunteer their time and skills to help non-profit organizations and that he&#8217;s looking forward to attending the event again next year.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 18:58:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Matt: Common at Tiny Desk\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46868\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/common-at-tiny-desk/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:443:\"<p></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/\">Tiny Desk concert</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/03/496433228/common-tiny-desk-concert-at-the-white-house\">White House with Common</a> and some of my favorite musicians <a href=\"http://www.robertglasper.com/\">Robert Glasper</a>, <a href=\"http://music.derrickhodge.com/\">Derrick Hodge</a>, and <a href=\"http://bilalmusic.com/\">Bilal</a> was incredible.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 14:28:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7 to Introduce User-Specific Language Setting for the Admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63054\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-to-introduce-user-specific-language-setting-for-the-admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1948:\"<p>WordPress 4.7 will allow users to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38705\" target=\"_blank\">select a language to use in the admin</a>. Prior to this change, using a different language for the admin required installing the necessary translations and editing the <em>wp-config.php</em> file or using a plugin.</p>\n<p>A user-specific language setting makes it possible to run a WordPress site in one language on the front end and administrate it in another without all of the previous hassle. For example, if a German newspaper site has contributors from all around the world, WordPress 4.7 makes it possible for each contributor to use the admin in his or her native language. The setting is available as a language dropdown on the user profile edit screen at <strong>wp-admin/profile.php</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/admin-language-setting.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/admin-language-setting.png?resize=1025%2C325&ssl=1\" alt=\"admin-language-setting\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63059\" /></a></p>\n<p>During my first test of the new feature I thought it was broken, but it turns out the setting is not visible if the site language is set to the default en_US. Change the site language under Settings to something else and WordPress will then show available translations in the user profile language dropdown.</p>\n<p>The user-specific language setting comes as a result of work on a two-year-old <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29783\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> and contributors&#8217; discussions at several European WordCamps during the past few years. It introduces a new <code>get_user_locale()</code> function that plugin developers will want to be aware of, especially those who have built other solutions that allow users to set a language for the admin.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:22:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: LinkedIn Learning Is Offering Free Access This Week to Its Library of More Than 5,000 Courses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63072\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://wptavern.com/linkedin-learning-is-offering-free-access-this-week-to-its-library-of-more-than-5000-courses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2104:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.lynda.com/\">Lynda.com</a>, a site that offers <a href=\"https://www.lynda.com/subject/all\">thousands of online training courses</a> is giving everyone an opportunity to access any course they want for free.

Some people on Telegram just pick random emoji and they don&#8217;t care about the equivalence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Telegram sticker collection matches those in the iMessage sticker app after an update Douglas pushed this morning. Just a handful of the planned stickers are currently available, but users will automatically receive the new ones as the iOS app and Telegram pack are updated. Douglas said Automattic is planning to add more Wapuu created for the WordCamps and is looking into commissioning a few new ones for the app.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 17:58:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"Post Status: WordPress REST API in Core — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=30103\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-rest-api-core-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1964:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

And that is why I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must – at that moment – become the center of the universe.</p></blockquote>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 17:32:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: Defrauding an Election\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/defrauding-an-election/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1186:\"<p>Wired has a fun and informative look at <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wireds-totally-legit-guide-rigging-presidential-election/\">How to Rig a Presidential Election in 1000 Easy Steps</a>.

Meth is seeking $11,338 to create a number of 7&#8243; Wapuu plush toys.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The factories that produce most of these items are in China and there are large minimum orders,&#8221; Meth said. &#8220;I have done the calculations and have tried to keep the Kickstarter goal at a minimum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meth has previous experience creating plush toys for other software projects. Last year, he <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy\">successfully raised $35K</a> from 432 backers to create a PHP Woolly Mammoth plush toy. While the web version of Wapuu features the WordPress logo, the plush toy does not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress logo is a trademark of the WordPress Foundation,&#8221; Meth said. &#8220;I did not get permission to use their logo. I am in no way affiliated with WordPress. This product is a plush toy, not software and on his chest is just a regular W with a circle around it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If successfully funded, backers won&#8217;t receive the product for at least a few months as the orders are created, processed, and shipped from China to Canada. Meth will then package the orders and ship them to backers, &#8220;I have done it before and have figured out the best ways to get these items to backers quickly and efficiently,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Pledges range from purchasing one plush toy up to five. There&#8217;s also a pledge available for about $763 where companies can have their advertising materials shipped with each toy.</p>\n<p>So far, Meth has raised <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/plush-wapuu-collectible-unofficial-wordpress-masco\">$676 from 20 backers</a> with 29 days left to go. Considering the lack of Wapuu plush toys in existence, these would be excellent collectibles to give away at WordCamps.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 20:22:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Orlando Rescheduled for November 12-13\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-orlando-rescheduled-for-november-12-13\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1336:\"<p>WordCamp Orlando which was originally scheduled for October 9-10 will now take place the weekend of<a href=\"https://2016.orlando.wordcamp.org/2016/10/12/wordcamp-orlando-2016-is-rescheduled/\"> November 12-13</a>.

The sign in front of the establishment features steaks and chops, but the restaurant&#8217;s pizza is &#8220;one of the great under-appreciated pies in all of NYC,&#8221; according to BuddyPress core developers.</p>\n<p>This release is heavy on features for developers, in line with the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-7-development-kicks-off-project-shifts-focus-to-developers-and-site-builders\" target=\"_blank\">recent change of course</a>. The BuddyPress core team is now focusing on the experience of developers and site builders, as opposed to providing something that is 100% turnkey.</p>\n<p>Version 2.7 delivers significant performance improvements to sites that are using the Groups component. <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/group-queries-have-been-rewritten-for-bp-2-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Group queries have been completely re-written</a> to be less memory-intensive by following WordPress&#8217; move to use the &#8220;split&#8221; model for object queries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The changes we’ve made for BP 2.7 should lead to a huge performance improvement on sites using persistent caching,&#8221; BuddyPress lead developer Boone Gorges said. &#8220;When querying groups, not only are group objects now fetched from the cache when available, but the ID queries themselves are cached as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 2.7 is rather lean on user-facing features but one helpful addition is a new email token that makes it possible for users to <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6932\" target=\"_blank\">unsubscribe from BuddyPress-generated emails</a>. The unsubscribe links have been added to the emails that are listed on the email settings page.</p>\n<p>This release also introduces many improvements for site administrators, which will make BuddyPress easier to manage and customize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use WP Page Names for Headings of BP Directory Pages</strong><br />\nWhatever you choose as the title of your Activity, Sites, Members, or Groups directory pages on the back end, is what you’ll get as the heading on the front end.</li>\n<li><strong>Use the Site Icon as Your Site’s Profile Photo</strong><br />\nBuddyPress sets the site admin’s profile photo as the default site profile photo on the Sites Directory page. You can now use the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Favicon#WordPress_Version_4.3_or_later\" target=\"_blank\">Site Icon introduced in WordPress 4.3</a> instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Member Type and Group Type Filters in Users and Groups Admin Screens</strong><br />\nEasily filter your members and groups by type and set types in bulk on the users and groups list tables in the dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Profile Date Field</strong><br />\nNew Date Field settings, “Date format” and “Range”, make it easier for site administrators to decide how date-based data will be collected and displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the first release since the project&#8217;s new developer-oriented direction was announced. The improvements shipped in 2.7 reflect the core development team&#8217;s commitment to better serve those who are developing and managing BuddyPress sites.

David Kennedy <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38833/\" target=\"_blank\">merged Twenty Seventeen into core</a> yesterday as his first commit to WordPress. Any remaining development issues for the project will now be managed via Trac.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/18/twenty-seventeen-merge-proposal-for-4-7/\" target=\"_blank\">merge proposal</a>, Kennedy described Twenty Seventeen as &#8220;an ambitious theme that focuses on a creative home page and an easy site setup experience for users.&#8221; It is the first default theme designed specifically for business websites. The theme includes four customizable panels on the front page (as seen in Kennedy&#8217;s demo video below), which can be set to display content from existing pages. It includes support for uploading a custom logo and uses SVG icons throughout the theme, which Kennedy notes is a first for a default theme.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]--><br />\n<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/panels-ui-small.mp4\">https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/panels-ui-small.mp4</a></div>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen will offer three different options for a color scheme: light, dark, or custom (which can be set via a user-friendly color-picker):</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/colors.mp4\">https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/colors.mp4</a></div>\n<p>&#8220;Twenty Seventeen will ship with its current implementation of panels in the theme and without video headers,&#8221; Kennedy said during yesterday&#8217;s core development meeting. A <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38172\" target=\"_blank\">ticket for adding core support for video headers</a> is open on Trac and contributors are still working out all of the intricacies of the feature. It may not be ready to ship with the first version of Twenty Seventeen, but it&#8217;s an exciting step forward for standardizing an approach for developers who want to build video headers into their themes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Video headers are definitely doable,&#8221; Nick Halsey said during yesterday&#8217;s meeting. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of getting consensus on the best approach on the ticket.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors have also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37974\" target=\"_blank\">discussed creating a multi-panel page</a> that lets users select content for the different sections. It would benefit Twenty Seventeen but contributors are considering giving it more time in development as a feature plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Regarding multi-panel, I’d agree that it’s not going to make it,&#8221; Kennedy said in the #core Slack channel today. &#8220;That isn’t to diminish the awesome work done so far, but it needs more. I’d like to start making plans for it to be a feature plugin, perhaps. I want to see the momentum continue. Core needs a solution around this, and it will take more people to help make it even better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen has had 59 contributors to date and may gain a few more before the 4.7 release cycle is finished. The theme will benefit from testing in as many different environments as possible, since it will immediately be high profile as the next default WordPress theme.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 18:19:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"WPTavern: WordCamp WarmUp Is a Success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=62874\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-warmup-is-a-success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2384:\"<p>Rebecca Gill, founder of <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/\">Web-Savvy-Marketing</a>, has published a postmortem of <a href=\"https://2016.annarbor.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-warmup/\">WordCamp WarmUp</a>, an event that took place two days before WordCamp Ann Arbor aimed at breaking the ice for new WordCamp attendees. The event surpassed its goal of 50 attendees forcing Gill to close registration early.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not only did most WarmUp guests arrive right on time, we had a full room of WarmUp attendees and even had a few unexpected friends show up,&#8221; Gill said.</p>\n<p>Gill created three different lists that included interesting things about attendees, their interests, and their talents. She then created packets that attendees could use to seek out specific people, &#8220;I’m not sure how many people used my lists, but I will say most people took packets with them when they left the event,&#8221; Gill said.</p>\n<p>She challenged attendees to meet at least 20 people during WordCamp Ann Arbor. While a handful of people completed the challenge, its purpose was to provide an additional incentive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really don’t care how many people an individual met,&#8221; Gill said. &#8220;My goal was to get them to meet more than they would without WarmUp and to encourage them to get to know others if their personalities allowed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gill conducted a poll shortly after the event to gather feedback and received 15 responses. When asked how the event made their WordCamp experience more meaningful, a number of people offered positive feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was nice to come on Friday and already recognize some people</li>\n<li>I was able to connect with other WordCamp goers, which made the following days more exciting. It helped me orient myself mentally to think ahead about what I wanted to learn and what I wanted to get out of the event as a whole.</li>\n<li>I met some people! So then there were familiar faces at the actual WordCamp.</li>\n<li>The event was a great ice breaker to WordCamp.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To read all of the feedback and view photos of the event, check out the <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2016/10/recap-of-wordcamp-ann-arbors-wordcamp-warmup/\">wrapup post</a>.

I’m also pretty excited about the pieces of the admin that are about to start using it with such a short window. 4.8 and 4.9 have a ton of potential with the API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors in attendance at today&#8217;s core development meeting agreed that the team had made significant strides to meet the conditions previously identified for merge. After a short few minutes of discussion, WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí officially approved the WP REST API content endpoints for merge into core.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/WP-API/WP-API\" target=\"_blank\">Code on the GitHub</a> repository will now be frozen and continued development will be managed via WordPress trac. The WP REST API has had 99 contributors on the project to date.

The project, formerly known as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/26/customizer-transactions-proposal/\" target=\"_blank\">Customizer Transactions</a>, brings the underlying architecture required for the ability to save a session as a draft. It enables WordPress to save a set of changes made in the Customizer so that it can be shared, previewed outside of the iframe, and even published at a future date.</p>\n<p>Although the initial introduction of Customize Changesets will ship with no UI, it is the gateway for a host of exciting new features in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new APIs make possible many new user-facing features in future releases and feature plugins, including saving long-lived drafts, submitting changesets as pending for review, scheduling changes, seeing the previewed state on the frontend without being in an iframe, sharing preview URLs with others who do not have customizer access, and others,&#8221; project lead Weston Ruter said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/12/customize-changesets-formerly-transactions-merge-proposal/\" target=\"_blank\">merge proposal</a>.</p>\n<p>Users will be able to detect the Customize Changesets architecture in WordPress in two ways. A new customize_uuid query parameter is added onto the URL. Also, users can now reload pages in the Customizer and the changes that have already been made will persist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In future releases we can explore new UIs to take advantage of the new capabilities that changesets provide,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;New UIs can provide a way to schedule changes, the ability to undo the last change, show an audit log (revision history) for changes, collaborative editing of a customizer changeset, and so on. Future feature projects will explore many of these and feature plugins will start to prototype them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter also noted that Customize changesets fixes &#8220;several long-standing issues related to incompatibilities between JavaScript running on the site’s frontend when previewed in the customizer.&#8221; This should make the experience of customizing WordPress less buggy for users.</p>\n<p>When I asked Ruter if the UI for core will come from the Customize Snapshots feature plugin, he said he&#8217;s not certain whether the team will migrate the features into a separate “Customize Changesets UI” plugin or adapt it to make use of changesets instead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Either way, the UI features will live on and will be prototyped in feature plugin form before proposal for core merge,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;The underlying plumbing from Snapshots was adapted for changesets now in core. So the snapshots itself needs its internals to be gutted to re-use changesets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From there contributors will begin <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31089#comment:11\" target=\"_blank\">building a UI for managing changesets</a>, which includes listing existing changesets and their revisions, as well as moving a changeset post from auto-draft to draft, pending, or future. Ruter encourages those who want to contribute to a changesets UI for core to get involved in the <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots\" target=\"_blank\">Customize Snapshots plugin on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:25:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.7.0 – “Migliaccio”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=260004\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://buddypress.org/2016/10/buddypress-2-7-0-migliaccio/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9299:\"<p>BuddyPress 2.7 “Migliaccio” is now available for download from the WordPress.org plugin repository, or right from your WordPress Dashboard. “Migliaccio” focuses on new features for developers and site builders.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"dashicons dashicons-list-view\"></span> Groups Query Overhaul</strong><br />\nHuge performance improvements on sites using persistent caching.

I hope my story will inspire people that came from schools that don’t teach too much technical stuff and people that are coming from remote or not highly developed places It won’t be a hindrance in getting a good WordPress related job.</p>\n<h3>Web Development in my early years</h3>\n<p>I had a first glimpse about web development around the mid 90’s when my dad was able to manage in buying an IBM-clone 4&#215;86 for me. It was marquees and frameset were the cool stuffs back then. During our college, not too much is being taught in our school and Internet is slow and very limited so I have to learn on my own and mostly at home. It’s amazing to imagine that we were able to survive with a 56kps dial-up connection way back then.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLa-YgTgtqp/\" target=\"_blank\">my first computer circa 90s #oldpic</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 11, 2016 at 4:46am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was able to get a lot of practice in programming because my other batchmates were too lazy to do their school projects. They easily give up, rant a lot about the school’s broken facilities and would rather play Warcraft DOTA or Counter Strike while I am busy doing thesis projects. At that time, I was into electronics and was using other CMSes for web based projects because I had the impression that WordPress is just a blogging platform and not as powerful as the others.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLc6P9LglLd/\" target=\"_blank\">Worth the effort, sleepless nights of research and programming #collegedays #oldpic</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 11, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Entering The Corporate Office Scene While Undergraduate</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to financial issues, I have to work on my own to finish up my last few years of studies but it did not became a hindrance for me in getting my degree. The fastest way to get a job here without any diploma and experience is through contact centers. I am very thankful to this industry because many filipinos got a decent living out of it specially for those people that came from the provinces.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLcNZirA69o/\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Support days at Epson &#8211; Teleperformance</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 11, 2016 at 4:17pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>After a year of struggle with the traffic and balancing my life with school and work, finally I got my diploma. I tried to pursue an office based tech related career but most of the job openings needs at least 1 years experience and based in Makati, which is 2 hours away from me. I was able to land an office based job but I gave up in less than 6 months because of the huge amount of time and effort that I loose during the commute. Imagine, an average filipino loses 4 hours of time during the travel. In a month, it translates to at least 80 hours of wasted time. Multiply that to the millions of the office workers that travels everyday.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLdCy4Ig-W9/\" target=\"_blank\">View of #metromanila from #antipolo it looks near but traffic will kill your time  #drone #aerialphotography</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 12, 2016 at 12:03am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Shifting from Tech Support to a Web Developer</h3>\n<p>Good thing, there is newly opened web development company here in Antipolo so I left my job from the Metro to grab this opportunity closer to home. Luckily my web development projects from college served as my portfolio to land into that job. At this point of time, we are not mainly using WordPress and only use it as the part of the SEO process. A year has passed and I tried applying to companies that offers remote positions, luckily I was accepted by an Australian web development company. Before I switched my career in a remote working environment, I got married.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLc8Iy_AT4D/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> got married &amp; changing to a work-from-home setting at that time</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 11, 2016 at 11:05pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>With my employer at that time, we are still not using WordPress as our main CMS and using single-sign-on connector to manage it. After years of doing this process, when major revisions of the other CMSes rolled out, we’re having hard time coping up with the compatibility of modules, extensions, plugins and themes. Then we saw some of our blogging sites that is running on WordPress, still solid and with minimal issues during major updates. We offered upgrade packages to clients but some of them view it as a rip-off because they already spent a lot in the development and after a few years, they will be paying again for an upgrade which they don’t really care about as long as they have a website running.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLa6_Czgzcw/\" target=\"_blank\">The #family that works together, stays together</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 11, 2016 at 4:17am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Awakening WordPress in me</h3>\n<p>At work, we studied WordPress in-depth, researched it and compared it with other, and was able to discover that there are already huge sites that is running solely on WP so why do we still have to run it side-by-side with another CMS? It’s scalable, easy to manage, extended via plugins and communicate with other system using its REST API. Then we got ourselves busy by getting migration projects from other CMS to WordPress. When I got immersed with WP projects, I never looked back and never again tried another CMS or programming languages.</p>\n<h3>Mastering WordPress</h3>\n<p>I applied again with another interesting employer, this time under the US timezone, they are the one that introduced me to the WordPress ecosystem. The owner Toby C, served as my idol and mentor in the WP world. He encouraged us to contribute and allotted 5% of our work time to contribute back to the WP Community. He is very active in their local community and meetups. WordPress became our primary choice for all projects, if client do not trust WP as their CMS, we don’t do it. At this time, I am now a believer that WordPress can scale on large projects, we’re able to utilize multi-sites, we were able to work in teams, use version control properly, we even used a custom WP site as our internal project management system. We created custom themes and plugins for each client’s specific needs. We lived and breathed WP everyday. It’s fun working with them and even met with one of my remote team mates on another province.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BB7dAich_a0/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS &amp; WordPress Usergroup meetup in UP Los Banos, 1st time to meet my remote workmate Abel @TheMightyMo</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Feb 18, 2016 at 5:16am PST</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately after 2 years, the 12 hours time difference of US and Philippines worn me out easily. Good thing about WordPress is there are abundant jobs available and was able to find another employer with a Danish company which is only has 6 hours time difference. Their main business is catering ice, cocktails, wines, bar tending stuff, etc. but their front-end online platform is all built with WordPress &amp; WooCommerce. From here, I was able to harness the power of WP and WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>Contributing back to the WordPress</h3>\n<p>I’m very thankful that WordPress has the REST API and it helped me create custom endpoints for 3rd party integrations, but still it has a lot of shortcomings and documentation is not perfect. Instead of ranting out those issues, it encouraged me to reach out in the WordPress.org support forums. I just found out that the WP codex will be deprecated soon and will be replaced with a more streamlined support system which is currently in the making by a group of volunteers around the world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WP community is very friendly and will point you to the right person on whom to get in touch with if you have any WP related questions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There, I met Jon A., one of the most supportive person in the forums, as well as Hugh L. (big fan of his WP plugin template), both of them is leading that Codex replacement project at that time. From them, I was inspired to give back some of my spare time by contributing to the project that they are working on. Another thing that I love with the community is even if your contribution is big or small, it doesn’t matter, they will always make you feel awesome and urge you to help more.</p>\n<h3>Spreading the WordPress Community in the Philippines</h3>\n<p>I am very active in attending events and hackathons here in the PH but I noticed that there is still a lot people look down to WP developers because of the mindset that is just a blogging platform, but hey you can rapidly prototype a Minimum Viable Product with it and win some hackathon like what we did in this Bitcoin event. I also noticed that there are a lot of WordPress groupies here in the Philippines but it seems they are divided and after years of observing, nobody is organizing a local group. Luckily after months of waiting, our WordPress Meetup group for Manila was approved and we are now on a mission to unite the local WP community and reviving the WordCamp which became dormant after 2012. If ever you are in the province and cannot attend to our monthly gathering in the PH, I’ll do my best to help you out in getting your local community started or simply fill out the meetup application.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m also glad that under the spirit of Open Source, we have the support of other local communities like Drupal and Mozilla that help each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since then, I try my best to accommodate schools in the provinces that requests to talk in their school or organization, engage them to learn Web Development and WordPress, help them not to be discouraged even they are far from the city and from a remote location, there is a big chance to have a WP related job to be found.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLXlCargWoE/\" target=\"_blank\">Thank you Batangas IT Society for inviting me to share topics about #webdevelopment and #WordPress</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Carl Alberto (@carl.alberto) on Oct 9, 2016 at 9:07pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Set Me Free\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Set%20Me%20Free&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-set-free%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Set Me Free\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-set-free%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-set-free%2F&title=WordPress+Set+Me+Free\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Set Me Free\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-set-free/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101816-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Set Me Free\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Set Me Free\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-set-free/\" title=\"WordPress Set Me Free\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-set-free/\">WordPress Set Me Free</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 10:00:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Carl Alberto\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Why PixelGrade is Experimenting with a $225 WordPress Theme on Themeforest\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=62807\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/why-pixelgrade-is-experimenting-with-a-225-wordpress-theme-on-themeforest\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8947:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sami-k.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sami-k.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" alt=\"sami-k\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-62748\" /></a>This post was contributed by guest author <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\">Sami Keijonen</a>.

They want to think outside of the box and push the boundaries. Based on the theme shop&#8217;s wild yet functional <a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/\">designs</a> and the anti-corporate thoughts expressed in the co-founder&#8217;s <a href=\"https://medium.com/@vladpotter/our-saga-of-not-giving-a-fuck-about-market-sense-108f7d0749a7#.shqg2u48o\" target=\"_blank\">Our Saga</a> article, I have to say that I like PixelGrade&#8217;s approach.</p>\n<p>Vlad Olaru, co-founder of PixelGrade, was kind enough to answer a couple of questions about the Pile theme price increase.</p>\n<h4>Why did you raise Pile&#8217;s price by 281%?</h4>\n<p>The first obvious answer is that now we can set our own prices on ThemeForest due to Envato extending the Author Driven Pricing to the WordPress category. We’ve been preparing for this for a long time.</p>\n<p>But just because you can do something, that doesn’t mean you should, right? We have been thinking about our business strategy for quite some time now &#8211; and not in a shallow way.</p>\n<p>We’ve gone through a painful process of rediscovering our core values and purpose, what kind of experience we wish to offer to our customers, and what kind of customers we want to attract and keep aboard.</p>\n<p>A direct consequence of this whole process is rethinking our pricing based on our firm belief that not all products are created equal. We haven’t thought in terms of percentages (it’s the first time the 281% comes to mind &#8211; thank you for doing the math), but in terms of our overall effort and value delivered to the customer.</p>\n<h4>Why $225 and not $150, for example? Did you do some research before making the decision?</h4>\n<p>Yes we did, and it was very thorough. We did not base it on market fit, market tolerance, or anything like this. On the contrary, it was an internal research focused on the the two pillars mentioned earlier: how much do we work for something (effort invested) and how much does it help our customers (real value).</p>\n<p>First, we needed some numerical relation between the various types of themes we produce, in terms of complexity. We’ve divided each theme’s design into components and identified the overlaps, meaning work that is built upon to deliver higher level functionality (i.e a style guide is used to create a blog section).</p>\n<p>So, with a clearer picture of the overlaps and the actual effort needed for each stage, we’ve analyzed how much value a customer gets from these specific components.</p>\n<p>This helps us to fairly and wisely distribute our efforts, while at the same time identifying where we can decrease or increase the price. With higher delivered value comes a greater acceptance for higher prices.</p>\n<p>In the end, we’ve come up with a set of price multipliers starting from our lowest offering, the blogging theme. By the way, we don’t intend on selling the core design separately. With this clear relation between the three categories, we’ve ran simulations to see where is the point where we can generate a healthy monthly income and get a manageable number of customers.</p>\n<p>“Manageable” is a very key concept in this whole scheme because it relates directly to the experience we wish to craft for each customer through our Customer Happiness department.</p>\n<p>We feel personally involved in the success of our customers&#8217; online endeavors. You can’t really do that when you focus on volume. A close and personal relationship needs a thoughtful balancing act for it to flourish.</p>\n<p>So there you have it &#8211; the “magic” revealed.</p>\n<h4>What kind of customers are you looking for with this price change?</h4>\n<p>As I’ve said before, we are currently focusing on three main personas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hobby-driven people (storytellers, journalists, travelers, life/fashion/design bloggers)</li>\n<li>Creative Entrepreneurs (photographers, visual artists, designers, architects)</li>\n<li>Small Local Businesses (restaurants, coffee/tea shops, boutiques, small studios)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don’t think all the people that fit these categories can digest the prices above, at least not in the current state of the market. On the other hand, we are not delusional. But I highly believe we can make a pretty good case to enough of them about the added value they get when trusting us.</p>\n<p>Of course, it will be an uphill struggle with the habits and assumptions ingrained by the years of “bazaar marketplace.” Our bet is that we are doing things right and the right thing, at the same time.</p>\n<h4>So if a $59 customer won&#8217;t buy a $225 theme, what is PixelGrade going to do to attract $225 customers to the platform and specifically, the item.</h4>\n<p>First of all, you need to see this whole (not so new) pricing structure in a more global approach. We are currently selling our themes through our own shop, on WordPress.com, and ThemeForest.</p>\n<p>For about two years now, all of our shop and WordPress.com themes have been priced at $125. They are all blogging themes. We are pretty happy with how things worked out. So we don’t know if ThemeForest is the place where people would be willing to value our themes at these prices. We are hopeful and we will definitely give our best, but it is still too early to tell.</p>\n<p>We are going to focus most of our marketing efforts on attracting the right kind of customers to our own shop because we are in full control of the whole experience. On ThemeForest and WordPress.com we can’t do the same due to how a marketplace at this scale functions. Hopefully, Envato will do its part (as it has been in recent times &#8211; kind of slowly for our liking, but still) and the right type of potential customers will get to judge our offering.</p>\n<h4>Are you experimenting with your top-selling themes or just doing a trial with one of the themes in the collection?</h4>\n<p>Once again, I think times are changing on ThemeForest and we are taking it one step at a time. The ideal future would be one where all of our themes, regardless of distribution channel, would be priced the same.</p>\n<p>We are definitely keeping an eye on the opportunity to take the next step, but it is still too early to give a time frame.</p>\n<h4>How do you bring the rest of the marketplace into 2016 pricing without being accused of price collusion?</h4>\n<p>Price collusion? I had to google that.</p>\n<p>We have no plan to make any sort of agreement with anybody. We will do what we feel is right and aligned to our core values, talk about it, and, hopefully, others will follow suit.</p>\n<p>Now that I have read that definition, I realize that you might be referring to the concern (expressed by some pre-sale comments on ThemeForest) that we might be driven by greed here. Far from it. If that was the story, we would have lowered our prices and driven out the competition (as I suspect some will do). Like they say, with great liberty comes great responsibility.</p>\n<p>We will shape our message on value-pricing and do our best to live up to these self-imposed standards. The customers will be the most accurate judge of our stance on this.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Are you ready for higher prices?</h4>\n<p>Thanks again, Vlad, for answering the questions. It will be interesting to see how it goes.</p>\n<p>I don’t have a strong opinion about the company increasing prices to that degree. I can see myself selling themes for $125, but I hope $225 works well for PixelGrade.</p>\n<p>As a customer, would you buy a theme for $225 and what would make it worth it?</p>\n<p>Any other theme shops have plans for increasing prices?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 03:11:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WP REST API Content Endpoints Conditionally Approved for Merge in 4.7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=61815\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-content-endpoints-conditionally-approved-for-merge-in-4-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3694:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-rest-api.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-rest-api.jpg?resize=1025%2C469&ssl=1\" alt=\"wp-rest-api\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43000\" /></a></p>\n<p>The WP REST API team and WordPress core contributors met tonight to decide whether to merge the content endpoints in 4.7. After the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/08/rest-api-merge-proposal-part-2-content-api/\" target=\"_blank\">merge proposal</a> was published a week ago, several core developers expressed concern regarding the brokered authentication scheme and the team has since decided to remove it from the proposal in favor of focusing on it for the 4.8 development cycle.</p>\n<p>Discussion at the meeting tonight centered around six topics: security, performance, user feedback, if merging will negatively impact API development, whether content endpoints will benefit core development, and whether those endpoints belong on every WordPress site. The team also discussed possible ways to measure the success of the project once it has been merged into core.</p>\n<p>Contributors agreed on a conditional approval for merging the endpoints, provided that the team address outstanding questions on object meta and that others outside of the REST API team provide a proof of concept for how WordPress core can use the endpoints. These conditions must be met before the enhancement deadline next Wednesday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making something work in core does not mean committing it to trunk,&#8221; WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí said. &#8220;This is also a call to the greater dev community &#8211; there is a chance to do something that doesn’t necessarily carry the weight of being shipped in core that can serve as proof that you want something. A developer’s vote.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hou-Sandí said that requiring the proofs to be created by developers outside of the REST API team will demonstrate &#8220;how other people experience the development process.&#8221; It also frees up the project&#8217;s team to focus on other pre-merge tasks.</p>\n<p>Multiple proofs of concept are encouraged and some of the features being considered include Press This, Quick Draft, infinite scroll on admin list tables, and anything else anyone wants to try. Adam Silverstein volunteered to take a crack at Press This and by the conclusion of the meeting said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got Press This creating new posts already actually, that was pretty straightforward to switch over.&#8221; He plans to include his work in a new ticket on trac.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have no blocking objection but I am pretty wary and want to make sure that conditions for keeping in 4.7 are hammered out in the next 24 hours and conditions for beyond worked on before beta,&#8221; Hou-Sandí said. Matt Mullenweg, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the project&#8217;s readiness so far, agreed with her statement but also said he isn&#8217;t yet satisfied with how the team plans to measure the success of the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also feel like the measure of success is still woefully undefined, and there&#8217;s still a lot of fuzziness in the core arguments of &#8216;if this is in [core] people will use it more,\'&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Contributors seem very motivated in the final stretch and are working towards producing the necessary proofs of concept prior to the enhancements deadline. If any of the proofs are solid enough to be merged, the WP REST API content endpoints will ship in WordPress 4.7 alongside a core feature that is using the API.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 04:31:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: Headway 3.8.9 Patches Potential XSS Vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=62793\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/headway-3-8-9-patches-potential-xss-vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5000:\"<p>If you noticed an update for Headway, it&#8217;s not your mind playing tricks. Late last week, Headway Themes released version 3.8.9 to patch a potential security vulnerability involving the license key field. The vulnerability was discovered and reported to <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri </a>by Gary Bairéad, a former Headway Themes employee.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, the company has not publicly announced the <a href=\"https://headwaythemes.com/downloads/headway/?changelog=1\">availability of 3.8.9</a> to customers. The update comes more than a month since founders Grant and Clay Griffiths <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-confirms-financial-difficulties-issues-apology-to-customers\">issued an apology</a> for the lack of customer support and communication.</p>\n<h2>Lack of Communication and Support Continues</h2>\n<p>Since the apology was published, the <a href=\"http://headwaythemes.com/blog/\">company&#8217;s blog</a> and social media accounts have remained silent. Bairéad continues to use his site to update the public on the status of Headway Themes. In his most <a href=\"https://headwayupdate.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/still-no-support/\">recent post</a>, Bairéad published a number of screenshots that show the company is still not providing the level of support <a href=\"http://headwaythemes.com/policies/support-policy/\">advertised on its site</a>.</p>\n<h2>One Month Progress Report</h2>\n<p>I reached out to Grant and Clay Griffiths to find out what progress they&#8217;ve made on providing &#8220;a first level of support service&#8221; as mentioned in the apology, what steps they&#8217;ve taken to rebuild the business, and if they have any comments on Bairéad&#8217;s article.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support is being provided and updates have been and will continue to be pushed,&#8221; Grant said. &#8220;We are also in contact with Influx to further improve our support,&#8221; Clay said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://influx.com/\">Influx</a> provides customer support for companies, including those in the WordPress ecosystem such as <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">Advanced Custom Fields</a>. Influx has elastic pricing allowing companies to pay for the amount of support they need. Prices start at $199 per month and increase as the number of responses increases.</p>\n<p>While the Griffiths did not recognize unpaid staff in their apology, former employees have since received partial payments of the money they are owed.</p>\n<h2>Community Is Optimistic About Headway Fork</h2>\n<p>While the future of Headway Themes and its product remain in limbo, many in the community are optimistically supporting a fork called <a href=\"http://bloxthemebuilder.com/\">Blox Builder</a>. Blox is a <a href=\"http://bloxthemebuilder.com/start-downloading-beta-blox-theme-v1-0-0/\">fork of Headway 3.8.8</a> created by Maarten Schraven that is 100% GPL licensed.</p>\n<h2>Headway is Not 100% GPL</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://headwaythemes.com/legal/terms-service/\">Headway Theme&#8217;s terms of service</a>, &#8220;All WordPress themes produced by Headway Themes, LLC are released under the GPL version 2.0 license.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A key difference between Blox and Headway is that Blox doesn&#8217;t use <a href=\"https://imperavi.com/redactor/\">Redactor.js</a>, a WYSISWYG editor. The script is $199 and its <a href=\"https://imperavi.com/redactor/license/\">license agreement</a> makes it incompatible with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Upfront, a product created by WPMU Dev <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/introducing-upfront/?utm_expid=3606929-87.FQUx5sKvRhKbhK_8_C59WQ.0\">launched with Redactor.js</a>.

Considering Clay is a co-owner of a WordPress business that sells a product that is not 100% GPL, should he be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/former-headway-themes-employee-goes-public-staff-has-not-been-paid-and-customers-are-not-receiving-support#comment-196834\">able to</a> sponsor WordCamps <a href=\"https://2016.la.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">advertising Pressmatic</a>?

The &#8220;unofficial announcement&#8221; was not a secret, as Gardner has been hinting at it on social media and also <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2977620-WooCommerce-Shop-Page\" target=\"_blank\">posted a sneak peak on Dribbble</a> of StudioPress&#8217; upcoming WooCommerce theme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/studiopress-woocommerce.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/studiopress-woocommerce.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"studiopress-woocommerce\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62780\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We are focusing our themes and I&#8217;m literally designing one as we speak that will be WooCommerce compatible,&#8221; Gardner said. &#8220;The writing is on the wall. We&#8217;re now at a point where we can focus and dedicate some of our time. My hope is that we can take all our existing themes on StudioPress and work in the WooCommerce component &#8211; at the very least &#8211; to make WooCommerce out of the box look good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>StudioPress, one of the oldest shops in the WordPress themes marketplace, has <a href=\"http://my.studiopress.com/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">58 themes in its collection</a>, including 18 themes developed by third parties. Getting the entire collection compatible with WooCommerce will take some time. Gardner said the company&#8217;s initial focus will be ensuring compatibility for all new products.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our emphasis then will be on continuing to just design and develop themes for the Genesis framework and all that,&#8221; Gardner said. &#8220;But as a side note, all of our themes will be styled at a basic level for anyone who wants to use a theme and start selling stuff. So WooCommerce and e-commerce for us is definitely on the radar and the roadmap.&#8221;</p>\n<p>StudioPress plans to release its first WooCommerce theme in the next couple weeks.</p>\n<h3>Embracing the Competition: Mullenweg Shares Long-Term Vision for WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, the featured guest on the podcast where Gardner confirmed StudioPress&#8217; plans to add WooCommerce compatibility to the roadmap, seemed pleasantly surprised to hear the news. As CEO of Automattic, Mullenweg would arguably be StudioPress&#8217; chief competitor for WooCommerce theme products, but he shared an interesting approach to competition within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can compete and cooperate at the same time, especially if you think long term,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I just think of it as what is the best long-term thing for WordPress as a whole?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since acquiring WooCommerce, Mullenweg said Automattic has increased the size of the Woo team by over 40% and the developers on the core software have gone up by 5x.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more people working on the software and we&#8217;re looking at it from a very long term view,&#8221; he said. Mullenweg elaborated on his vision for making WooCommerce &#8220;a commerce engine for the next decade:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>E-commerce for WordPress needs to be a platform, meaning that the core software that drives the commerce engine needs to be available as widely as possible and really robust. It needs to be something that scales from a small store selling just a handful of t-shirts to really huge stores with 60 &#8211; 70,000 SKUs doing tens of mullions or hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. We wanted that to be something that lots of other businesses could be built on. Woo was the best fit that we identified at the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg, who has in the past identified external threats to WordPress as far bigger than any intra-WordPress open source threats, encourages WordPress businesses to work together. Mullenweg noted that Wix is spending 160 million dollars this year in advertising to drive people signing up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are things we have to keep in mind and also do some coordination across the community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we all kind of run our own directions and just try to localize and maximize our own profits and everything, we&#8217;ll be out-gunned by these other companies. Because the truth is that Wix&#8217;s $300M in revenue is bigger than any company I&#8217;m aware of in the WordPress space individually, but it&#8217;s much smaller than we are collectively. So then the question becomes: How can we work together? How can we team up? And how do we get the right philosophies and the right ways of doing business and best practices so that as we do our own things in our own places, we&#8217;re heading the same direction in a way that no company could ever compete with &#8211; just like the Encyclopedia Britannica could never compete with Wikipedia.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During his WordSesh session this year, Mullenweg said he has been entertaining the idea of organizing a WordPress Growth Council for those who are &#8220;invested in WordPress&#8217; growth and whose business models are predicated on the growing pie of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can grow the pie far faster than we can take a share from people in the same pie,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a much bigger opportunity.&#8221; Embracing WooCommerce themes competition from companies like StudioPress, while increasing opportunities for all companies who want to compete, is one example of this idea in action. Gardner said Automattic&#8217;s greater vision for WooCommerce, following its acquisition, was one of the major factors in his decision to add WooCommerce compatibility to the StudioPress roadmap.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has not yet published any official plans for the possibility of a growth council, but his response to intra-WooCommerce competition seems to set a precedent for cooperation within the community with an increased focus on competing together against external threats to WordPress.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 20:41:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Behind the Scenes of WordPress.com Themes with David Kennedy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=62746\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-of-wordpress-com-themes-with-david-kennedy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11383:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sami-k.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sami-k.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" alt=\"sami-k\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-62748\" /></a>This post was contributed by guest author <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\">Sami Keijonen</a>. Sami is a math teacher who enjoys learning about the web, accessibility, and WordPress. He juggles between freelancing, building themes at Foxland, and teaching.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I’ve been doing several <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/tag/wordpress-theme-shops/\">WordPress Theme Shop interviews</a> lately. The original reason for the interviews was that people kept asking me where to find well-designed WordPress themes. (Yes, I know the irony because I also create solid themes.)</p>\n<p>The interviews have been valuable for helping users find themes they like, analyzing different business models for selling themes, and exploring the history, present, and future of WordPress themes.</p>\n<p>This time I’m thrilled to publish an interview with <a href=\"https://davidakennedy.com/\">David A. Kennedy</a> from <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>. I see him as respected Theminator (we’ll get to this title later on) who cares about accessibility.</p>\n<p>We talked about themes on WordPress.com, Twenty Seventeen, theme user experience, and other theme-related topics.</p>\n<h3>David A. Kennedy Introduction</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your role at Automattic.</em></strong></p>\n<p>I’m David A. Kennedy and my official title at Automattic is Theminator. That really means I do a bit of everything with themes. My primary role is to watch over premium themes on WordPress.com, making sure shops have whatever they need to be successful.</p>\n<p>I also launch free and premium themes and contribute to Components and other internal theme projects.</p>\n<p>In my free time, I play a lot of video games.</p>\n<p>Coming up, I&#8217;ll be helping lead the release of Twenty Seventeen, the next default theme for WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Twenty Seventeen</h3>\n<p><strong><em>What makes you excited about Twenty Seventeen?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Everything! It&#8217;s an honor to help lead the release of a default theme and have the opportunity to make something amazing with the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>The task I most look forward to is finding the balance between pushing the boundaries of what should be done in a default theme versus fostering best practices for everyone who opens it up to learn from.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What are the biggest pain points you see when developing Twenty Seventeen?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Making the homepage setup as simple and effortless as possible for people. This isn&#8217;t just a pain point for Twenty Seventeen but also for the vast majority of themes out there.</p>\n<p>Front Page should be done in a way that makes the most sense for users. I hope to validate that through user testing and plenty of iteration.</p>\n<p>Core developers, themers and the community all have the responsibility to improve it. There&#8217;s never been a better time to get involved and help solve a big challenge for WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What We Look For in Themes</h3>\n<p><strong><em>You just published an article <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2016/09/01/what-we-look-for-in-themes/\">what you look for in themes for WP.com</a>. Can you summarize what kind of themes WP.com users are looking for? Is there a pattern for themes that are the most popular?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking for the best of the best. That&#8217;s a tough mark to hit for anyone, even for us when we&#8217;re designing our own themes. I recently <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2016/09/01/what-we-look-for-in-themes/\">published a post on our blog, ThemeShaper</a>, about some of the timeless things we look for in a theme.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, our users always want themes that just work. That means themes that keep options to a minimum and require little setup to look fantastic.</p>\n<h3>Theme User Experience</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Can you offer some insight on what &#8220;theme user experience&#8221; (TUX) means?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2016/08/30/theme-user-experience-requirements/\">a post about this recently on ThemeShaper</a>.</p>\n<p>User experience is the overall experience of a person using a product. Similarly, the TUX list is a set of best practices that will help a theme&#8217;s experience be as easy as possible for people.</p>\n<p>We still have a long way to go toward substantially improving people’s WordPress theme experience, but it&#8217;s a start, and we encourage everyone to use the TUX list today.</p>\n<h3>Accessibility in WordPress.com</h3>\n<p><strong><em>How do you ensure that all new themes are as accessible as possible on WP.com?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We pay a lot of attention to keyboard accessibility since it&#8217;s the foundation of good accessibility and has a ripple effect that touches many areas. It&#8217;s on our development checklist and it&#8217;s something we test for in every theme that launches on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>We also actively look for ways to improve accessibility in our starter-theme projects, like Underscores and Components. Anything that goes in there makes it to all the themes we launch.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Have you considered requiring all new themes to be accessibility-ready?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I see more possibility for an impact in every theme we release when we focus on some of the more foundational aspects of making a theme accessibility-ready. In that way, we get many more accessible themes, faster.</p>\n<p>A lot of accessibility is having quality code, and that&#8217;s what we can ensure more easily right now. Whether a theme goes all the way to meet the accessibility-ready requirements is really the decision of the theme author.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve released a handful of accessibility-ready themes recently, as have many of our theme shops on WordPress.com.</p>\n<h3>Showcase Your Coolest Themes</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Showcase two of your or Automattic themes that you are most proud of. Why are they cool themes?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Picking two themes is tough, but here it goes!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sela.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sela.jpg?resize=1025%2C615&ssl=1\" alt=\"sela\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62767\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/sela/\">Sela</a>: Users of both WordPress.com and WordPress.org love Sela and use it for all kinds of sites, from life-coaching consultants to municipal portals. We think it&#8217;s pretty awesome for its versatility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Pique.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Pique.jpg?resize=1025%2C504&ssl=1\" alt=\"pique\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62768\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pique/\">Pique</a>: Pique has a modern feel from a design standpoint, plus it really changed the way we thought about setting up a home page in a WordPress theme. Its panel-driven layout helped inspire some of our other themes and a lot of experimentation.</p>\n<h3>Workflow</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Is there any specific workflow for how Automattic themes are built and which tools you use? Do you have designers who create layouts in Sketch or Photoshop and developers who continue with the code, etc.?</em></strong></p>\n<p>To start the code of our new themes, we use <a href=\"http://components.underscores.me/\">Components</a>, a new starter-theme generator we built. The design tools depend on the theme wrangler working on the theme. Some like Sketch, some like Photoshop. Some design in the browser.</p>\n<p>The only thing that really matters is whether the process works for the wrangler doing the work.</p>\n<h3>Wearing Many Hats</h3>\n<p><strong><em>WP.com theme wranglers can wear many hats. They can be theme reviewers, designers, developers, and more. Which hats do you wear, which is your favorite, and why?</em></strong></p>\n<p>The best thing about my job is wearing those different hats. I do all those things but am definitely more comfortable as a developer rather than a designer.</p>\n<p>My two favorite hats are the developer one and the teacher one. I like creating things, but quite honestly, I like it even more when I get to teach people what I know. More often than not, whomever I&#8217;m teaching teaches me more. That happens often through theme reviews, so the combination of building themes and reviewing them is a fun one for me.</p>\n<h3>Is WordPress.com Open for New Theme Shops?</h3>\n<p><strong><em>How can new theme authors submit their commercial themes to WP.com? It used to be open submission but as far as I know it’s now closed. Any plans to change that?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We hope to open the form up some time in the future, but don&#8217;t have a concrete date. We do invite new shops to WordPress.com when we find themes we love.</p>\n<p>Whether our marketplace is officially accepting new theme shops or not, we’re always looking for amazing, new themes. Make one, put it out there, and we’ll probably find it.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Business Strategy on Themes</h3>\n<p><strong><em>How do you market themes on WP.com and what is Automattic&#8217;s business strategy on themes? Do you focus more on free themes than commercial ones?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t do any special marketing on WordPress.com for themes. Lately, we&#8217;ve focused on creating more free themes because our theme shops provide plenty of awesome premium themes. Our focus this year has been finding ways to make all themes on WordPress.com as easy to use as possible.</p>\n<h3>Future of Themes</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Do you see themes going in a certain direction in the future? How do you feel about Javascript-based themes for example?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re big fans of the REST API, JavaScript, and its future in WordPress theming.  We&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2015/11/23/javascript-theme-tutorial/\">explored a bit here.</a></p>\n<p>We see a future where themes become more focused on specific use cases, are as lean possible and just work upon activation. We&#8217;ve aimed to instill many of these principles in Components.</p>\n<p>In order for theming to advance for both themers and users, more themers need to get involved in Core. So much help is needed and a lot of it doesn&#8217;t involve writing code.</p>\n<h3>Open Floor</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Any tips and tricks you’d like to share?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve subscribed to a few more newsletters lately that have helped with general inspiration and ideas, especially outside of the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>My two favorite are <a href=\"http://sidebar.io/\">Sidebar</a> and <a href=\"http://css-weekly.com/\">CSS Weekly</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thanks, David, for answering the questions.

The plugin, which Conti says has nearly 20,000 users, is one of the few effective solutions for combatting WordPress, multisite, BuddyPress, and bbPress spammers and sploggers. Conti was struggling to pay for the servers and, after six years of supporting the plugin, had only received six donations from the community.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After 6 years of work and only 6 donations,I don’t see that people appreciate WangGuard, so I’m Shutting Down WGG.Thanks for your confidence</p>\n<p>&mdash; WangGuard (@wangguard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wangguard/status/785185033359360002\">October 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>After receiving encouragement from fans and users, as well as a generous donation of servers from a hosting company, Conti <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/wangguard-service-plugin-development-and-support-service#/\" target=\"_blank\">launched an Indiegogo campaign</a> to fund future support and development of the service. The goal is set at $35,000, out of which Conti will need to pay the Indiegogo commission, the Gateway commission, and taxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal of this campaign is to cover the expenses of a full year of my work to improve WangGuard and to keep providing support for free to all users,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;I’m not aiming to become a millionaire, just to be able to work and improve a service which has more than 20,000 active users per day with benefits for sites all around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Conti if he has considered offering a commercial tier to cover the time he puts into supporting the plugin&#8217;s users, which he said averages 20 hours per week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought about charging for WangGuard, but it&#8217;s something I wanted to do for the community,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;And I was hoping that the community, seeing the benefits it gave them, would donate to me. But that has not been the case.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conti named WangGuard after a fierce warrior from Chinese mythology who served as a protector and guardian of the palace. (After launching the plugin he discovered the meaning in English but found that many people liked the name, so he decided not to change it.) The plugin and service blocked 710,000 sploggers its first year, 15 million the third year, and has blocked 220 million sploggers to date. Conti said its effectiveness has now reached 99%.</p>\n<p>Conti wants to keep the plugin free for all users and plans to create a campaign every year to raise funds for WangGuard development and support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have always believed that WangGuard is truly needed and everyone deserves to use it for free,&#8221; Conti said in his campaign overview. &#8220;But, on the other hand, I can’t afford to keep paying all expenses for the maintenance of the best (in my opinion) anti-splog service. I need help.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far the WangGuard campaign has received $1,145 towards its flexible goal of $35,000 and there are two months remaining until it closes.</p>\n<p>Conti&#8217;s situation highlights the plight of many WordPress.org plugin developers who offer free products and receive meager donations for their efforts. Some of these plugins amass large user bases that depend on them but not all plugin authors are prepared to create a commercial operation to support their continued efforts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ffreaker\">@ffreaker</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgibbs\">@pgibbs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hnla\">@hnla</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wangguard\">@wangguard</a> search/replace is at least 1000 uses a day, maybe get something once or twice a year.</p>\n<p>&mdash; David Coveney (@davecoveney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davecoveney/status/785769780733063168\">October 11, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgibbs\">@pgibbs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hnla\">@hnla</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wangguard\">@wangguard</a> nobody donates.

Maybe the WordPress repository needs another design that makes the importance of donations for developers more visible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People think that everything is free. It is, but there is an effort behind it that people should value. Maybe they are not appreciating it, because nobody told them clearly that it should have value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although putting a price tag on a plugin is not necessarily an indicator of value, it allows users to demonstrate what they think it&#8217;s worth to them. Offering users a higher level of service for a price, also known as the freemium model, is the most common way plugin developers cover the costs of their time. However, not all developers who make free plugins want to run a business. Short of asking for donations or launching a fundraising campaign, is there anything a developer can do to cause people to value the time and effort put into supporting a free plugin?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 18:47:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Lizz Ehrenpreis Wins Kinsta’s $1,500 Travel Scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=62676\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/lizz-ehrenpreis-wins-kinstas-1500-travel-scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2751:\"<p>Last month, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kinsta-to-award-1500-travel-scholarship-for-wordcamp-us\">Kinsta announced</a> it would give away one $1,500 travel scholarship to pay for an individual&#8217;s airfare, lodging, and admission ticket to <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a>.

I have had the privilege of working with several WordPress companies as an agency employee and now as a freelancer, as a communications and marketing maven, but haven&#8217;t had a chance to attend many WordPress events.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve gone to two WordCamps, but that&#8217;s it! Being able to go to this huge event, learn more about WordPress, and connect with people I&#8217;ve only thus far interacted with through the magic of the internet and to see friends and colleagues is an enormous gift.</p>\n<p><strong>In what ways does the scholarship change or impact your life?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it certainly changes my December schedule in a good way! Aside from giving me the opportunity to meet new people and see the ones I adore, it&#8217;s also a huge learning and networking opportunity that I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise get&#8211;and its incredible timing considering I just went full-time freelance and launched out on my own.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you have been able to attend the event without the scholarship?</strong></p>\n<p>No, I wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this your first WordCamp US and what are you looking forward too most?</strong></p>\n<p>It is my first WordCamp US! I lived vicariously through social media and post-event recaps last year, and it looked enormously fun.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/\"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/\">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/\">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/\">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/\">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/\">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/\">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1-video\" width=\"632\" height=\"342\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world? WordPress now draws your attention to the events that help you continue improving your WordPress skills, meet friends, and, of course, publish!</p>\n<p>This is quickly becoming one of our favorite features. While you are in the dashboard (because you’re running updates and writing posts, right?) all upcoming WordCamps and official WordPress Meetups — local to you — will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Being part of the community can help you improve your WordPress skills and network with people you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet. Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Even More Developer Happiness <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/\">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like “Add New” links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Despite being <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/do-not-miss-the-biggest-wordcamp-in-europe/\" target=\"_blank\">promoted</a> as &#8220;the largest WordPress event to this day&#8221; with more than 3,000 expected attendees, WCEU 2017 fell short with 1,900 people on the ground. Attendees were 5% fewer than last year&#8217;s 2,000 in Vienna. Expectations ran high but organizers could not predict the 24% no-show rate once the event got started. This is more than double the 10% no-show rate for the previous four years.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s organizers do not have a simple explanation for the high no-show rate, but cite several factors, including a few dozen participants being <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-attendees-are-being-denied-visas-because-conference-ticket-price-is-too-low\" target=\"_blank\">denied visas</a>, higher local sales, an expensive location, and putting tickets on sale too early. Approximately 60% of attendees were from nearby countries, such as France, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>Ticket sales for 2017 were open immediately at the conclusion of the 2016 event in Vienna. Organizers found that tickets sold in the first six months had a 34% no-show rate as compared to 20% for those sold in 2017. As the event has often sold out in the past, prospective attendees may have felt pressure to purchase a ticket in advance without confirming the ability to attend. </p>\n<p>Posting increasingly higher attendance numbers isn&#8217;t one of the goals of the WordCamp, but planning accurately for the number of people who will attend is crucial for resource and budget planning. When one in four attendees is a no-show, the plans for food, swag, venue accommodations, and other aspects of the event are askew.</p>\n<p>Organizers did not mention <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-kicks-off-with-contributor-day-focused-on-growing-wordpress-through-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\">Contributor Day</a> attendance in the wrap-up report, but this may have been one of the most successful aspects of the event. It was held prior to the main conference days, which may explain the event&#8217;s unusually high attendance numbers. Organizers hosted 473 attendees for the 500 available contributors slots. </p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2017 Cost 300€ per Attendee, Sponsors Covered 80%</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Europe&#8217;s wrap-up report also includes a transparent breakdown of the event&#8217;s 700k€ budget. Catering costs for lunches, snacks and drinks, made up 50% of the budget. However, organizers were limited to the venue&#8217;s catering partners, which blurs the line between actual food versus venue costs. </p>\n<p>The team was unable to sell all of the sponsorship packages and was forced to reduce the budget by 149k€ along the way. WordCamp Central subsidized 10€/ticket and covered the final deficit of 28k€. The cost breakdown per attendee was 300€ with sponsors covering 80%, WordCamp Central 7%, and tickets sales 13%. These numbers show that the 40€ ticket price is a small fraction of the total costs required for an event of this size. </p>\n<p>Organizers said they felt it was important to share the data for educational purposes but also to &#8220;demonstrate to everyone who might have a doubt, that maintaining the ticket fee very low is meant to make our events accessible to all, but that the fee is not an indicator of the value of the conference.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:06:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4865\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2017/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9049:\"<p><i>We&#8217;re starting a new regular feature on this blog today. We&#8217;d like to keep everyone up-to-date about the happenings all across the WordPress open source project and highlight how you can get involved, so we&#8217;ll be posting a roundup of all the major WordPress news at the end of every month.</i></p>\n<p>Aside from other general news, the three big events in June were the release of WordPress 4.8, WordCamp Europe 2017, and the WordPress Community Summit. Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/\"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/\">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/\">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/\">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/\">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/\">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/\">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridget Willard <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/\">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li>A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li>The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/\">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li>It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/\">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li>The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress\">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li>After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href=\"https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/\">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li>If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 11:42:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Contributors Explore Adding Drag-and-Drop and Multi-Column Support for Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72638\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6817:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/building-blocks.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: ruudgreven <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/40811229@N07/6180817922\">DSC_0012</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>The new Gutenberg editor has an open ticket for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38#issuecomment-309998712\" target=\"_blank\">allowing users to sort blocks via drag and drop</a>. Blocks can currently be sorted with up and down arrows located to the left of the content but the beta only allows for single-column stacking.</p>\n<p>One of the goals for Gutenberg is to provide &#8220;a page building experience that makes it easy to create rich post layouts.&#8221; As far as layout building goes, the first planned versions of the new editor are very primitive as compared to Wix and Weebly&#8217;s drag and drop website builders where nearly every element on the page can be easily moved to a different position.</p>\n<p>Contributors have been discussing the intricacies of adding this feature to Gutenberg since February. James Nylen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38#issuecomment-309984280\" target=\"_blank\">summarized some of the challenges</a> that make drag and drop more complicated to implement: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Dragging and dropping a block is not really a one-step operation. It is more like 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press and hold mouse button or screen</li>\n<li>Move to desired location</li>\n<li>Release</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 is incredibly difficult to get right, and requires a lot of complicated behaviors like duplicating an item (or at least its general shape and size), scroll handling, and determining the intended new location, especially at the beginning and end of the content. We have all used bad drag-and-drop experiences, and I would argue they are worse than not having it at all.</p>\n<p>That said, for two-dimensional movement with columns, I agree that arrows alone are probably not a good solution. Though mobile support for that is going to be very tricky no matter how it works.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several commenters on the ticket agree that repeatedly clicking arrows to move blocks is cumbersome and will become untenable in the future when multi-column support is added. This would require up, down, right, and left arrows to rearrange content. Users have come to expect a drag-and-drop interface, because nearly every page builder application offers it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thinking of drag and drop as a progressive enhancement for desktops,&#8221; Joen Asmussen said. &#8220;One that would be great to have, but we should build it after we have explicit button actions in place for doing the same, including splitting into columns in the future. This decision is based on a desire to ensure accessibility as well as mobile devices can play the same game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asmussen marked the ticket priority as low in May and removed it from the beta milestone. At this point, users are not likely to see drag and drop in the first release that ships with WordPress core. </p>\n<h3>Multi-Column Layouts Planned for Gutenberg V2</h3>\n<p>The discussion surrounding adding drag-and-drop to the editor naturally leads into <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/219\" target=\"_blank\">adding multi-column support</a>. Limiting users to a single column is a one-dimensional approach to designing pages, but contributors don&#8217;t plan to leave Gutenberg without multi-column support for long. </p>\n<p>Geoarge Olaru, a designer at <a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PixelGrade</a>, shared a <a href=\"https://invis.io/3FAS8VQE8#/222711568_Creating_Columns_-_0\" target=\"_blank\">prototype</a> for adding a simple two or three-grid column layout to Gutenberg. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Extending WordPress further from the default Blog Posts automatically implies the need of multi-column layouts for presentation pages,&#8221; Olaru said. &#8220;I would prefer to tackle this feature upfront, rather than letting every developer do it on his own (see the multitude of page builders plugins).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/multi-column-mockup.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;For the V1 editor, I&#8217;m afraid columns like this is out of scope,&#8221; Asmussen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/219#issuecomment-285330922\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in reply to a Olaru&#8217;s ticket with mockups and a prototype for multi-column support. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a &#8216;no&#8217; — rather, we need some technical foundations to be solid first, before we commit to the really interesting stuff. But it might be a V1.1, or at the very least something for the customization folks later on in the year. Even before that, it would be good to keep this UI in mind, so that perhaps a plugin can add this even earlier.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Other commenters on the ticket feel more urgency about getting multi-column support into the first version of the editor. One of the concerns is that plugin developers will rush to add columns immediately based on demands from users, who will then have to migrate once core adds support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Multi column layouts are a must-have,&#8221; Anthony Hortin commented on the ticket. &#8220;At the moment, Gutenberg isn&#8217;t solving any issue. You still end up with one long column of content. The whole reason page builders are so popular, and why hundreds of thousands of people are using them, is because they provide the ability to easily make multi-column layouts. Without this functionality, you&#8217;re not providing any reason to use Gutenberg over a page builder plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the main challenges of adding multi-column support is figuring out what type of grid system to use and making sure that it scales from mobile to desktop. Weston Ruter joined the discussion to say that the foundational work for nested block support is being done now in version 1, but the UI for displaying them hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I appreciate the excitement and urgency to wanting columns,&#8221; Asmussen said. &#8220;We feel the same urgency. It&#8217;s not about not wanting columns, it&#8217;s purely about managing resources at this point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The good news is if you&#8217;ve been testing Gutenberg and wondering where some of these features are on the roadmap, they will be coming in later versions. While there may be disagreements about how much of a priority drag-and-drop and multi-column support should have for version 1, contributors agree that laying a solid technical foundation for these features is crucial for future extensibility.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Jul 2017 19:06:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.3.0 Adds Front-End Styles for Core Blocks, Notices Framework, and Text and Image Quick Inserts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72646\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-3-0-adds-front-end-styles-for-core-blocks-notices-framework-and-text-and-image-quick-inserts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4557:\"<p>Gutenberg development is marching ahead with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-june-30/\" target=\"_blank\">version 0.3.0</a> released today.

Gutenberg now displays <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1564\" target=\"_blank\">notices on post save, schedule, and update</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-notices.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 adds a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1555\" target=\"_blank\">block descriptions component</a> to blocks with inspector controls. Several of the core blocks now display descriptions. These will be especially useful when plugin developers begin adding their own custom blocks, offering users a quick way to see the purpose of the block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/block-description-e1498855903121.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds more placeholder text to various blocks, as &#8220;placeholders are key,&#8221; according to the newly added <a href=\"http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Gutenberg&selectedStory=Design&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=1&downPanel=storybooks%2Fstorybook-addon-knobs\" target=\"_blank\">design blueprints and principles</a> included in Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If your block can have a neutral placeholder state, it should. An image placeholder block shows a button to open the media library, a text placeholder block shows a writing prompt. By embracing placeholders we can predefine editable layouts, so all you have to do is fill out the blanks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 also adds several enhancements that make it easier to edit and customize the image-oriented blocks with more options and settings: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added “edit image” button to image and cover image blocks</li>\n<li>Added option to visually crop images in galleries for nicer alignment</li>\n<li>Added option to disable dimming the background in cover images</li>\n<li>Added option to display date and to configure number of posts in LatestPosts block</li>\n<li>Added text formatting to CoverImage block</li>\n<li>Added toggle option for fixed background in CoverImage</li>\n<li>Added placeholder for all text blocks</li>\n<li>Added placeholder text for headings, quotes, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Active installs for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin</a> have nearly doubled since last week and are at more than 900 sites. This is roughly 1% of the goal Matt Mullenweg set for testing on 100,000 sites before replacing the edit screen. The plugin may also be advertised in the dashboard in a future release, possibly 4.8.1, which is slated for the end of July.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 22:07:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Popular WordPress Plugins Slow to Add Meta Box Support for Calypso\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/popular-wordpress-plugins-slow-to-add-meta-box-support-for-calypso\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3361:\"<p>During the State of the Word at WordCamp US 2016, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">announced</a> that Calypso was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Nl6U7UotA-M?t=37m1s\">plugin aware</a>. Calypso is a REST API and React <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress\">powered application</a> for the desktop created by Automattic <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/\">in 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers with plugins active on 1M sites or more <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/10517\">received an email invitation</a> from Andy Peatling to begin building support for Calypso.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Calypso is now plugin-aware,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;This pull request was merged today, and as a way to bootstrap this, we’re opening up for what I just described for plugins to create Calypso interfaces for what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically saying, if you’re using Calypso on a site that has one of these plugins, let’s say WooCommerce, all of a sudden in the interface, there will be all the WooCommerce stuff. It’ll talk to the API, it will run on the desktop just like the rest of Calypso, and it will only be loaded if the plugin is active.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the major differences between <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/\">Calypso</a> and WP-Admin is that custom meta boxes added by plugins are not accessible in Calypso.</p>\n<p>Nearly seven months since the announcement, popular WordPress plugins have struggled to add meta box support, including those maintained by Automattic. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\">WordPress SEO</a>, active on more than 3M sites, is among the plugins that were selected to take part in the experiment.</p>\n<p>When asked about the progress of making WordPress SEO Calypso aware, Joost de Valk, founder of <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast.com</a>, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Automattic has seen little progress on the initiative, &#8220;No news to report at this time, but hope to have some soon,&#8221; Automattic representative Mark Armstrong said. WooCommerce has yet to add meta box support and settings pages in Calypso.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg, WordPress&#8217; new editor, is also built using React. One of the chief concerns expressed by users and developers is how it will <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952\">support custom meta boxes</a> built using the current PHP framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I miss a lot of the meta boxes I’m used to seeing on the screen,&#8221; <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin said</a>. &#8220;Things like Yoast SEO (on some sites) and custom taxonomies are just not shown. If every meta box ever made for WordPress needs to be remade, it sure is going to make developers lives a living hell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I want to use Calypso as a replacement for WP-Admin because it&#8217;s fast and I like the interface. However, I can&#8217;t do that until it supports meta boxes for the plugins I rely on, such as Edit Flow. Is the lack of custom meta box support for Calypso a sign of what&#8217;s to come with Gutenberg?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:05:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Netherlands Reinstated for 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72624\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-netherlands-reinstated-for-2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1924:\"<p>At WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to speak with WordCamp Netherlands organizers Marcel Bootsman and Luc Princen, along with WordPress Global Community Team members Josepha Haden and Andrea Middleton.

Although it is just a minor update, the release was a large undertaking with 1,600 commits from 84 contributors. </p>\n<p>The most exciting feature in 3.1 is the new built-in product importer/exporter that supports CSV files, a feature previously offered through extensions. The importer makes it easier to migrate stores from other e-commerce platforms, as well as add and update product information for existing stores. Users can select whether to update existing products or create new products and can map the data against product fields:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/woo-product-importer.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The tool is also useful for those selling across multiple storefronts or marketplaces and is capable of matching up data based on product ID or SKU. Please note that it only handles products and not customers and orders. Store owners looking to import those additional items will still need to use an extension.</p>\n<p>Version 3.1 also introduces the ability to manage WooCommerce.com extension licenses within WooCommerce core, eliminating the need to install the helper extension and copy subscription keys over. Customers can now connect their WooCommerce.com account to the site and download, manage, and activate extensions in the admin. Developers or agencies that have purchased extensions on behalf of clients will need to contact WooCommerce to transfer the subscriptions to a new owner in order for them to show up within the clients&#8217; admin. </p>\n<p>This release also includes several other improvements, including the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add oEmbeds to the product short description, more useful error messages</li>\n<li>More useful error messages</li>\n<li>Add oEmbeds to the product short description</li>\n<li>Customers can accept ‘Terms and conditions’ without leaving checkout</li>\n<li>Set stock statuses for variations in bulk from the edit product screen</li>\n<li>Small improvements to the setup wizard</li>\n<li>WooCommerce Services Plugin: Add live shipping rates for USPS and Canada Post and print discounted shipping labels for USPS without leaving the store</li>\n<li>New search helpers for orders to allow developers to query orders by multiple props</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to 3.0 due to extension incompatibilities. This is one of the reasons why WooCommerce recommends making backups of your store and testing the 3.1 update on a staging site to see how it affects themes and extensions. The changes in 3.1 should be backwards compatible with 3.0.x sites, but impact on extensions needs to be tested before pushing the update live.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:30:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: WordPress Opens Up More Channels for Gutenberg Testing and Feedback\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=72583&preview=true&preview_id=72583\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-opens-up-more-channels-for-gutenberg-testing-and-feedback\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3501:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/testing.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/23YKF6ZUWV\">Vojtech Okenka</a>\n<p>Gutenberg testing is in full swing and the WordPress Testing Handbook has a new page to help users <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">get started</a>. It clearly defines the purpose of the new block editor as not just for writing content but also for creating layouts. Users are invited to offer general feedback or engage in specific task-based tests.</p>\n<p>The new testing page erases boundaries for feedback by allowing users to submit their thoughts and suggestions using an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCVZ5ooeVYzjp26LAxKZVgkvcRraSTD6pRM_cjGuJfvLKQKw/viewform\">online form</a>. Previously, the only way to offer feedback was by creating an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">GitHub</a> or contacting the contributors on WordPress&#x27; #core-editor Slack channel. </p>\n<p>At this stage in Gutenberg development, it may be difficult to discern what is a bug versus what is an unpolished feature. WordPress is using Storybook, an interactive development and testing environment for React and React-Native UI components, to create <a href=\"http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/\">Gutenberg&#x27;s documentation</a>. However, this collection of documents focuses more on technical details for developers. The plugin&#x27;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/#developers\">changelog</a> may provide some information about which features should be working. Before reporting an issue in the feedback form, it&#x27;s a good idea to review the project&#x27;s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues\">GitHub issues</a> to see if it has already been logged.</p>\n<h3>Testing Gutenberg Outside of the WordPress&#x27; Developer Community is Critical to Its Success</h3>\n<p>A few weeks ago I helped one of my friends migrate her personal blog from Blogger to WordPress. She had put off setting up her new site for months after checking out the admin and getting overwhelmed. Getting familiar with the post editor was enough of a hurdle, without piling on the idea of widgets and shortcodes and different screens and methods for inserting different types of content. The new editor can solve this problem with a unified method of creating content and placing it on the page.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg has the potential to make WordPress content editing and layout building more user-friendly but only if it gets into the hands of non-technical users and those who are considering a switch from other platforms. WordPress&#x27; recurring <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-editor-experience-survey-shows-75-of-respondents-dont-use-distraction-free-writing-mode\">failure to collect feedback beyond its own development community</a> needs to be addressed if Gutenberg is going to become a product that will attract non-WordPress users.</p>\n<p>As the plugin is still in the very early beta stage, this is a crucial point in time when feedback can have a big impact on shaping Gutenberg&#x27;s development. Including non-technical users as early in the process as possible, as the new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">testing page</a> attempts to do, should provide a better overall picture of Gutenberg&#x27;s usability.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 20:30:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"WPTavern: Why Gutenberg?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72563\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wptavern.com/why-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7502:\"<p>At WordCamp Europe 2017, Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of the WordPress open source project, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\">announced</a> that Gutenberg was available as a plugin for testing. In the past few weeks, members of the community have published their experiences with the new editor. Some of the reviews I&#8217;ve read so far include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform wp-block-freeform\">\n<li><a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\"><cite></cite>Random Thoughts on Gutenberg </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joost.blog/gutenberg-and-yoast-seo/\">Gutenberg and Yoast SEO </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gschoppe.com/wordpress/improving-wordpress/improving-wordpress-pt-4-where-project-gutenberg-lost-me-open-letter-to-core/\">Improving WordPress Pt 4 – Where Gutenberg Lost Me (Open Letter to Core) </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wplift.com/gutenberg-editor-first-look\">A First Look at Gutenberg Editor for WordPress: Mixed Opinions </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Diving Into the New Gutenberg WordPress Editor (Pros and Cons) </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.customerservant.com/gutenberg-screen-reader-initial-thoughts-reactions/\">Gutenberg With A Screen Reader: Initial Thoughts And Reactions </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mrwweb.com/first-reactions-gutenberg-future-of-wordpress/\">First Reactions to Gutenberg, the Future of WordPress</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is one review in particular that has piqued my interest. Adrian Roselli not only <a href=\"http://adrianroselli.com/2017/06/first-reactions-to-gutenberg.html\">shares his first impressions</a> of Gutenberg, but also asks a couple of important questions and raises some interesting points:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blocks-quote-style-1 wp-block-quote\"><p>When I first heard about Gutenberg, I asked some people at WordCamp London and later at WordCamp Europe who had requested it. Remembering that WordCamp is open source, I then re-jiggered my question and asked what problem it was trying to solve.</p>\n<p>Of the people I asked, I do not know who was a contributor. The answer I overwhelmingly got back was that Matt wanted it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two things that concern me about Roselli&#8217;s statement. The first is that I have a few quirks with the current editor but I don&#8217;t often use short codes, custom HTML, or use custom embed codes. Thinking about what <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/aae8cdd1349c6af7a74e84174724526386643a6e/docs/design.md\">problems Gutenberg solves</a> is somewhat perplexing if they&#8217;re not problems I encounter on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The second is that people at WordCamps are answering the question by saying Mullenweg wants it in core. Roselli states that he doesn&#8217;t know if the people answering the question are contributors or not. Because Mullenweg wants something in core should never be the primary reason it&#8217;s added.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how one could come up with this answer. Earlier this year, Mullenweg took over core development as the project lead, and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle\">assigned</a> Automattic employees Matias Ventura and Joen Asmussen to lead the development of Gutenberg. As project lead, Mullenweg can bypass the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-discusses-core-focuses-downsides-of-a-consensus-driven-model-and-more-on-apply-filters-podcast\">concensus-driven model</a>, and do what he thinks is best for the project without going through a committee.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">2016 State of the Word</a>, Mullenweg announced that the Editor would be one of three core focuses for 2017. In January of this year, the team published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/17/editor-technical-overview/\">technical overview</a> of what the new editor would encompass. A month later, the team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/02/09/initial-editor-blocks-prototype-editor-testing/\">published an initial prototype</a> of a block-based editor.</p>\n<p>The team is moving rapidly with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-to-focus-on-managing-plugins-and-themes-gutenberg-targeted-for-5-0\">plans to ship Gutenberg</a> possibly in time for WordPress 5.0 expected later this year or early next. If all of the work thus far had to go through a committee, it&#8217;s likely Gutenberg development wouldn&#8217;t be where it&#8217;s at.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not enough people <a href=\"http://chrislema.com/misunderstanding-goal-gutenberg-writing-experience/\">understand the &#8216;Why&#8217; behind the project.</a> Who can blame them? Outside of specifying that it will help WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\">leapfrog its competitors</a>, there&#8217;s not a lot of information on official channels that concretely explains and supports the idea that Gutenberg is necessary for millions of users.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has a good track record of doing what&#8217;s best for the project. However, in the case of revamping the editor, which will radically change how everyone will create content in WordPress, it&#8217;s concerning that more user research, personas, usage data, etc. is not available to indicate such a major shift was warranted. There was an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-editor-experience-survey-shows-75-of-respondents-dont-use-distraction-free-writing-mode\">Editor survey published</a> earlier this year but the results were not representative of WordPress&#8217; global user base.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of assertions on ease of use are made on the Gutenberg plugin page, with nothing to back them up,&#8221; Roselli said.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is an exciting, ambitious project, but one that I&#8217;m not entirely sure is necessary. If WordPress core is going to fundamentally change the way I create content without giving me a choice, I want as much information and user research data as possible to convince me that it&#8217;s the better option.</p>\n<p>It may seem odd that these questions and concerns are being raised six months into the project but at the same time, development has moved so fast, it feels like the opportunity to have them addressed at the beginning was missed.</p>\n<p>Revamping the editor experience is a massive undertaking and, six months in, it&#8217;s not better than the editor I use today. I wrote this post in Gutenberg and it was a cumbersome, frustrating experience. It will need to address a lot of issues if it&#8217;s going to beat the current WordPress editor, let alone leapfrog its competitors. However, the team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg/\">making good progress</a> on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg needs as many testers as possible if it&#8217;s going to be the best editor in its class.

It picked me. I can remember the summer between kindergarten and first grade; I had a computer summer class that introduced me to my passion. The first day when my mother picked me up I exclaimed “mommy I want a computer for Christmas!” I was five and had no realization that in 1986 they would cost more than about everything I owned. I remember being upset that Santa did not bring me the computer that I had been wishing for since June. Growing up, any time I got the chance to sit in front of a computer, I took it for as long as I could. In high school, I even designed the website of one of the groups I was in. It was still online up until last year when CCHS did a website redesign. However, I never actively pursued a career with computers or even took a class for them since that summer. It was not until after I got into WordPress that I actually took a computer class, and now I have an associate&#8217;s in Information Technology.</p>\n<p>My first career was as a preschool teacher. I loved teaching, loved the joy that it gave me, but it was a very under-valued career.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most teachers, who go to college to become teachers, make anywhere between minimum wage to a dollar over that with no insurance and maybe a week’s paid vacation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While spending 45 plus hours every week, I was dedicated to teaching our future, I was barely getting bills paid. So many times I would have to pay bills late, worry how I was going to make sure the next bill gets paid, and have enough gas in my car to make it to work the rest of the week. I devoted twelve years to teaching colors, shapes, letters, numbers, and how to get along with others. While I loved to teach, I needed more. Plus, if I wanted to be able to take care of my daughter, I needed to make a change or I would never even be able to have a savings.</p>\n<h3>And Then There Was WordPress</h3>\n<p>Around 2011, I got the idea that I wanted to write a blog. I had heard my friend Chris talk about blogging so I knew he would point me in the right direction. At that time he was working on a security plugin to help the sites he managed for work. He told me “if you want me to help you build a blog, I&#8217;m going to teach you so you can do it on your own later.” We bought a domain, set up hosting, and ran the install. I instantly became hooked. The more I built, the more I wanted to learn about WordPress, and the more I wanted to do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Almost every night, after my daughter would go to bed, I would spend working on my blog, reading about what one can do with WordPress, and trying everything I learned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes things would go great, and other times I would accidentally delete out my entire site on FileZilla without a backup and would start from scratch again. Most of my learning came from my failed attempts and what not to do. That is what was my first clue that I would like to be a “fixer” instead of a “builder”.</p>\n<p>The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. By 2013 I decided that “I could actually do this. I could make money from WordPress” but I still had about zero clue of how to go about it. I decided to leave preschool for good. I took a full time job working for a local IT agency that also built sites on WordPress. I spent a year there but during that time Chris introduced me to Regina at WP Security Lock. We hit it off and I quickly became a part time employee in April of 2014 helping her with the sites she managed and then learning how to clean hacked websites.</p>\n<p>I spent almost two years working for WPSL. The first part of them I was working for the local agency. Regina showed me another option for working in WordPress. It was the idea of working remotely. My daughter was still at the age where she needed after school care, and it is expensive. So with the support of my then fiance, I took the leap to work remotely in September of 2014.</p>\n<p>Fast forward from working in with various plugin support teams and security support roles, to jumping into agency support that I did for almost a year, I am now at home with WP Media on their WP Rocket support team. While most do not feel that it is the most glamorous of career choices, I love fixing problems, finding solutions, and helping people. Most of all, WordPress and working with support, gives me many teaching opportunities to help out every person who asks.</p>\n<h3>The Want to Teach</h3>\n<p>My first ever WordPress Community event was WP Engine’s 10 year birthday party they threw for WordPress in Austin. The feeling the Austin WP community gave me led me to feel like this was really a place I wanted to be. After Chris saw how excited I was about the community, he asked if I would like to go to WordCamp Chicago. Coincidentally, four years ago today, I was attending my first ever WordCamp. How the speakers taught the attendees, my goal was to learn as much as I could about WordPress so I too, can teach.</p>\n<p>Even though I no longer had the official title of a teacher, I still loved to teach. WordCamp Austin 2014 gave me the first opportunity to teach others about Jetpack. I was a nervous wreck! Not only was my best friend there who I looked up to in the WordPress community, but also one of the wonderful Happiness Engineers for the Jetpack team. I had Kraft go over my slides for me to make sure there was not anything I was sticking my foot in my mouth for and away we went. Afterwards I had people coming up and thanking me for explaining Jetpack in a way they could understand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After that WordCamp, I wanted to speak at all WordCamps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the many advantages of working for companies that have roots in the WordPress Community is that they allow me to attend, speak, and volunteer at WordCamps. I now have over 20 speaking opportunities under my belt, and have no want to stop for the unforeseeable future. I love having any opportunity to teach. I have now grown from only speaking at WordCamps to teaching beginner’s WordPress at our local community college, writing a book on beginner’s WordPress, and starting WP Kids Slack group to be a resource for KidsCamps and teaching our youth on the value and joys of WordPress. Now I am proud to say that I have taught WordPress to all ages from children to the baby boomers and it feels great! I have even had the opportunity to teach my own daughter WordPress and she loves going to the WordCamps. She has even helped others at Camps which for me is what it is all about. It is such a delight teaching Kids Camps and seeing their creativity blossom while building a site of their own. Plus, getting youth and teenagers interested in WordPress, coding, design, and more ensures that what we are building now, will only become better in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=From%20Teaching%20Toddlers%20to%20Teaching%20the%20World&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fteaching-toddlers-teaching-world%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fteaching-toddlers-teaching-world%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fteaching-toddlers-teaching-world%2F&title=From+Teaching+Toddlers+to+Teaching+the+World\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/teaching-toddlers-teaching-world/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/062817-min-150x150.jpg&description=From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/teaching-toddlers-teaching-world/\" title=\"From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/teaching-toddlers-teaching-world/\">From Teaching Toddlers to Teaching the World</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 14:15:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Michele Butcher-Jones\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Automattic to Renew Efforts on Underscores, Retire Components Starter-Theme Generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70860\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-renew-efforts-on-underscores-retire-components-starter-theme-generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7346:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/underscores.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>For the past several months we have received inquiries about Automattic&#8217;s open source <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores</a> starter theme. After six months of no commits to the <a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/_s\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> and pull requests left unanswered, users and contributors were beginning to wonder whether the project was abandoned.</p>\n<p>After contacting Automattic to get a status update on Underscores, the company confirmed that it is still an active project but would not explain why it had gone dormant for six months.</p>\n<p>For the past couple weeks there have been a sudden flurry of commits to the Underscores repository, the first activity since December 2016. The project has come out of hibernation and Automattic announced its intentions to <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/\" target=\"_blank\">renew its efforts in maintaining it</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we continue to push for consistency in themes and imagine what they might become with Gutenberg, we’re bringing our attention back to Underscores,&#8221; David Kennedy said. &#8220;In the last year, we’ve gotten a lot of questions from the community about Underscores and whether we had abandoned it. No way! It’s a stable project, and we enjoyed working on something new, away from it. It gave us better perspective and more ideas for the future of Underscores.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kennedy explained how the project&#8217;s maintainers have spent the past year and a half experimenting with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-components-with-5-new-starter-themes-based-on-underscores\" target=\"_blank\">Components</a>, a starter-theme generator that was created to provide a more modular approach to theme development with reusable building blocks. The team has decided to retire Components in favor of refocusing on Underscores and applying what they learned from the experiment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The generator we built to piece the different components together got complex quickly,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;We created a plugin to test builds locally and struggled with a seamless way to make many starter themes from one code base. The original idea is still solid: make starter themes do more by crafting them out of building blocks. But we didn’t hit the mark, so we’re retiring Components.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Underscores Adds Ulrich Pogson as New Committer</h3>\n<p>Automattic has named <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/grapplerulrich/\" target=\"_blank\">Ulrich Pogson</a> as a new committer to Underscores, the second non-Automattic contributor, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2014/04/22/commit-access-underscores/\" target=\"_blank\">following Philip Arthur Moore</a>, to receive commit access. Pogson is a WordPress contributor and meetup organizer, a member of the Theme Review Team, and an independent voice for the Underscores community.</p>\n<p>Philip Arthur Moore <a href=\"https://philip.blog/2017/06/27/wp-underscores-future/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he was excited to hear the news and thankful to Automattic for &#8220;not allowing Underscores to rot on the vine any longer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s fair to say that my involvement with the starter theme will likely come out of a coma and find new life,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;This is exactly what the theming community needs right now, and I couldn’t be more excited to see what we come up with and create.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In early January, the Underscores community shared concerns regarding the project&#8217;s general lack of leadership and transparency. Contributor Sami Keijonen wrote an article with constructive ideas for <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/underscores-development/\" target=\"_blank\">how Automattic could improve Underscores development</a>. One of his suggestions for the project was to identify leadership for moving forward, a person or group of people who could be responsible to review and discuss issues and pull requests more frequently. This would encourage more active discussion and testing of pull requests.</p>\n<p>In the comments of this post, <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/underscores-development/#comment-22416\" target=\"_blank\">Pogson expressed similar concerns</a> and said he would potentially be interested in creating a fork of Underscores.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally I am also hesitant to contribute as I am not sure when the PR will be merged,&#8221; Pogson said. &#8220;I would like to see regular feedback instead of instead of PR’s being merged in a merging spree. There is also a clash between _s fulfilling Automattic needs and at the same time as the community needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now that Pogson has been named a committer, he may be able to assist the team in maintaining active discussion on issues and keeping pull requests moving.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A large number of people use Underscores as a base for their clients and for themes on w.org,&#8221; Pogson said. &#8220;I would like to bring in things that have made me a better developer and make it easier for others getting started.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogson said he is still finding his position in the team and he anticipates he will most likely be merging simple PRs in the beginning. He enjoys working on Underscores and said he regularly likes to go through opened issues and give feedback.</p>\n<p>Sami Keijonen said he thinks the addition of Pogson as a committer is &#8220;very good news.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are bringing the focus back on Underscores, and they can bring the best ideas of Components to Underscores,&#8221; Keijonen said. &#8220;Ulrich is the perfect choice as a new committer. He has been involved in the development for a long time and knows the big picture. It’s also good to see a committer from outside of Automattic. Different kinds of perspectives are always welcome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keijonen said he is also optimistic that David Kennedy has taken a more active leadership role and hopes the project will continue to benefit from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With all that said <code>_s</code> is still Automattic’s starter theme,&#8221; Keijonen said. &#8220;It can mean more wp.com related decisions in the future. That’s one reason why many have their own fork of <code>_s</code>.&#8221; He cited a few examples of companies that have active forks of Underscores to suit their particular interests, including <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s\" target=\"_blank\">WebDevStudios</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ZeelandFamily/zf-theme\" target=\"_blank\">Zeeland Family</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air\" target=\"_blank\">Digitoimisto Dude Studio</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be an interesting partnership as I am the only committer who has not worked at Automattic,&#8221; Pogson said. &#8220;I think there will always be a certain clash between what Automattic needs and what the community wants, just because of the nature of the project. Many plugin authors have the same problem where they get requests that are not ideal for the other customers. There is still a bit of uncertainty but I am sure these things will be clarified in the future.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 21:01:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:144:\"WPTavern: Catalina Alvarez is Conducting the First Occupational Psychology Study on Autonomous Motivation and Burnout in the WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71964\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/catalina-alvarez-is-conducting-the-first-occupational-psychology-study-on-autonomous-motivation-and-burnout-in-the-wordpress-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1652:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/computer-paper-coffee.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/JHJH4PS68L\">WDnet Studio</a>\n<p>While attending WordCamp Europe I met Catalina Alvarez, a Master&#8217;s degree student at Paris 8 University, who is studying Occupational Psychology and Human Resources. She is in the process of writing her thesis about WordPress community health, with a focus on &#8220;autonomous motivation as a moderator in the Demands-Burnout relationship.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alvarez is conducting a <a href=\"http://cataalvarezp.polldaddy.com/s/motivation-burnout-in-wordpress-community\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> as part of her research and is inviting anyone in the WordPress community who has contributed, whether to code or community projects, to participate. One of the theories she is testing is that burnout is not the consequence of the demands of one&#8217;s work but rather the consequence of long periods of stress. She is also testing to see if autonomous motivation (when you do things because you are passionate about them) can reduce burnout and if external motivation contributes to burnout.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://cataalvarezp.polldaddy.com/s/motivation-burnout-in-wordpress-community\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> takes approximately 5-10 minutes and will close on July 5, 2017.

Apply Filters is a podcast dedicated to WordPress development.</p>\n<p>During the interview, Mullenweg touched on a number of topics including, a progress report on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle\">three core focus areas</a>, why he stepped back into the project lead role, and what&#8217;s not being talked about enough in the WordPress world.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few things in this episode that piqued my interest. Near the beginning of the interview, Mullenweg is asked if there was a tipping point that made him decide to take on the role of project lead again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been personally frustrated by how long it has taken to do some things that I think should be relatively simple,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Hearing that from other release leads over the past few years, and seeing some of the frustration because we have this rotating release lead philosophy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So hearing them voice some of the same frustrations, I was like, okay, maybe this is something more with how the project is organized versus something that I personally am having trouble with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a couple of years of releases that were a little uninspiring from the point of view of moving the needle forward for its adoption, even though they did a lot of great things and people worked really hard on them, and we closed 700 tickets, and had 130 or 150 contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were beating or we were doing a good job on a lot of metrics that we were tracking, but, on the whole, I think it really started to feel like WordPress was falling behind the state of the art in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was interesting to hear Mullenweg admit that WordPress releases in the last couple of years have been a bit uninspiring. This is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wow-factor-in-major-wordpress-releases-is-getting-few-and-far-between\">a sentiment I</a> and <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-4-0-hugely-underwhelming/?utm_expid=3606929-74.aeX0WyvtRVa7qMe8Ph5smw.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">others</a> in the community have shared in recent years. Development of Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\">WordPress&#8217; new editor</a>, has created a buzz around the project that I haven&#8217;t felt in a long time. It&#8217;s not surprising considering it is going to be the largest fundamental change to WordPress since its creation.</p>\n<h2>Disagree and Commit</h2>\n<p>During the discussions on whether or not to merge the REST API into core, Mullenweg argued that it shouldn&#8217;t be integrated until it was 100% complete. The core development team ultimately decided to merge it into core and iterate improvements. In the show, Mullenweg describes the disagree and commit principle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This idea that even though I disagreed with some of the things going in, the moment it was committed, I was advocating for it as strongly as anything else,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The historical thoughts or ideas or whatever I had don’t really matter at this point. It’s in, so I want to work to make it as widely adopted and successful as possible. That’s the commit part of it, which is funny because, in an open source world, commit obviously has a double meaning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But if you think about it, you can apply this to all parts of your life. Debate vigorously and have lots of arguments. Bring up all your worries or thoughts or concerns and hash it out. But once a decision has been made and the decision was made to bring the content endpoints in, don’t re-litigate it. That’s not really helpful to anyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of all, don’t sabotage it. It’s in, so let’s make it successful.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Downsides of a Consensus-Driven Model</h2>\n<p>Near the end of the interview, Mullenweg is asked what philosophy, feature, or topic in the WordPress world is not talked about enough. &#8220;The downsides of a consensus-driven model creating products,&#8221; he responded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I think that almost everyone at some point in their career has had a bad manager. And sometimes our reaction to that is to say that no one should be making decisions. There should be no managers, sort of like a more reactionary approach to it because that is true that it does solve the problem of the bad manager.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think what we miss is the only thing worse than a bad manager is 100 bad managers, which is sometimes what we get when we just try to make decisions or drive development of something like WordPress–which is, at the end of the day, a user product based on who shows up to a dev meeting that day, or what the loudest voices in the room might advocate for.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even policies that we’ve adopted in the past with WordPress, let’s say the 80/20 rule, which is on our principles page, can be misused and, I think, probably have been misused more the past few years than it has been used in the way it was intended.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just that kind of getting back to the question of how does this change a user’s life or not, and that reflects itself in an open marketplace through adoption. That is, I think, good to just remind ourselves of regularly because everyone, myself included, can get kind of down in the weeds of a particular ticket or idea we have or idea someone else has that might not be productive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To hear Mullenweg discuss these topics and more, I highly encourage you to listen to the <a href=\"http://applyfilters.fm/podcast/episode-81/\">full interview</a> which includes a transcript of the show.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 21:00:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: Heroin or Aspirin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://ma.tt/2017/06/heroin-or-aspirin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://ma.tt/2017/06/heroin-or-aspirin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:878:\"<blockquote><p>The company Bayer is famous for inventing aspirin in 1898, which is arguably one of the world<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2019.png\" alt=\"’\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />s most beloved brands, and for good reason.

Gutenberg developers emphasized that this feature should not be confused with the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; panel which is already working in a similar way to how it has in the past.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-cover-image.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While testing the Cover Image block with Twenty Seventeen and Twenty Fifteen, I was unable to get it working correctly on the frontend. Within the editor it works beautifully but once I launched the preview I found that, regardless of which positioning option I chose, I could not get the full image to display. The size of the image&#8217;s output was only as tall as the overlay text. If there was a right way to position it, I was unable to discover it. I checked with the development team and Matías Ventura said they are not loading styles for blocks in the front-end yet. Blocks like Cover Image that need CSS to display properly will not look right at the moment, but the plan is to focus on adding CSS for these this coming week.</p>\n<p>A few of the notable fixes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added button to delete a block</li>\n<li>Added button to open block settings in the inspector</li>\n<li>Rename “Freeform” block to “Classic Text”</li>\n<li>Added support for pages and custom post types</li>\n<li>Added ability to select all blocks with ctrl/command+A</li>\n<li>Automatically generate wrapper class for styling blocks</li>\n<li>Avoid triggering multi-select on right click</li>\n<li>Avoid being keyboard trapped on editor content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of today, Gutenberg has more than 500 active installs.

After the success of 4.8 and the initial release of Gutenberg last week, Mullenweg is aiming to see the plugin installed on 100K+ sites during the next few months before merging it into core. He also suggested that WordPress could put a promo for the plugin in the upcoming 4.8.1 release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the meantime I think we can do another user-focused 4.9 release with the theme of editing code and managing plugins and themes, doing v2s and polishing some features we brought into WP last year,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Weston and Mel already have some good ideas there, and we can start to discuss and brainstorm at the Dev chat next week. This will also allow the Gutenberg-driven release to be 5.0, which is a nice-to-have but not the primary driver of this decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg elaborated on changes to the release process in <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/06/4-8-and-whats-coming/\" target=\"_blank\">a post on his personal blog</a>. The original idea was for releases to be driven by improvements to the three focus areas (the editor, customizer, and REST API), but the radical changes that Gutenberg introduces to the editing experience means that customization improvements will need to wait until the editor is a little further along:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMel and Weston took this as an opportunity to think about not just the “Customizer”, which is a screen and code base within WP, but really thinking in a user-centric way about what it means to customize a site and they identified a number of low-hanging fruits, areas like widgets where we could have a big user impact with relatively little effort.</p>\n<p>WordPress is littered with little inconsistencies and gaps in the user experience that aren’t hard to fix, but are hard to notice the 500th time you’re looking at a screen.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think we’d be able to sustain the effort on the editor and still do a meaningful user release in the meantime, but we did, and I think we can do it again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During this week&#8217;s core development meeting, contributors brainstormed more specific items for inclusion in 4.9. The ability to schedule customizer changesets is one feature they discussed as a possibility. Customizer component co-maintainer Weston Ruter described the feature as &#8220;adding statuses for changesets: being able to draft a changeset to come back to later, and then to be able to schedule it to go live.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/\" target=\"_blank\">Customize Snapshots</a> feature plugin contains the UI for this and Customize Changesets, the term for the underlying infrastructure required for saving a Customizer session as a draft, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-to-ship-with-infrastructure-from-the-customize-snapshots-feature-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">was added in WordPress 4.7</a>. Adding the UI in WordPress 4.9 would allow users to share Customizer sessions, preview them outside of the iframe, and schedule them to publish at a future date.</p>\n<p>Andrew Roberts, a contributor to TinyMCE, said they should have a new mobile-optimized UX, which would result in a responsive toolbar, that could land within the proposed 4.9 timeframe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would wonder if we couldn&#8217;t tweak the UI to be closer to Gutenberg (e.g. white toolbars),&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;I had raised this idea before and it was thought it was better to wait until Gutenberg, but I remain of the opinion we could iterate a little bit closer to get users used to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors also discussed the possibility of changing the default font in the editor to ease the transition to Gutenberg in the future. Currently, Gutenberg uses system fonts for UI and Noto Serif for the editor text.</p>\n<p>Mel Choyce, who is heading the Customizer focus with Weston Ruter, said she hopes the team can finish the Gallery Widget for 4.9. Current progress on the widget can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/pull/120\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8.1 is tentatively planned for the last week in July, and contributors anticipate including a fix for some issues with the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40951\" target=\"_blank\">new Text Widget stripping out code</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:57:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress’ New Gutenberg Editor Now Available as a Plugin for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72098\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9087:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>One of the featured sessions at WordCamp Europe 2017 was Om Malik&#8217;s interview with Matt Mullenweg, followed by a 20-minute Q&amp;A from the audience.

Anyone interested in the future of WordPress will want to take it for a test drive, as the new editor will revolutionize the way users think about creating and editing content. The demo video at WordCamp Europe also showed Gutenberg working smoothly in a mobile context.</p>\n<p>At first glance, it may appear that WordPress is trying to copy its more recent competitors (Medium, Wix, and others) to keep pace, but the 14-year-old software has offered many of these content capabilities for years. Mullenweg explained how the new editor simply unifies the UI into blocks that can be placed anywhere. Gutenberg is set to replace widgets, the HTML UI of shortcodes, and blocks previously offered through the TinyMCE toolbar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-blocks.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken stabs at this before, if you imagine our previous efforts with post formats &#8211; to make it easier to do certain types of media or quote posts or things like that,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That whole concept can now flatten to just being a block. Working all that in, it&#8217;s bringing things we&#8217;ve been thinking about for a very long time in WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever sat down with a new user to introduce them to WordPress, then you probably answered a long list of painful questions regarding the many varied and confusing ways of creating content. Gutenberg has the potential to make WordPress much easier to use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now WordPress makes you learn a lot of concepts &#8211; shortcodes, widgets, the stuff that exists inside TinyMCE as blocks today &#8211; and people rightly wonder why they can&#8217;t use those things everywhere,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is shift it so that you only have to learn about blocks once and once you learn about the image block, that can be in a post, in a sidebar, in a page, in a custom post type, and it will work exactly the same way. Whatever is integrated with it, let&#8217;s say a plugin that brings in your Google Photos or your Dropbox, that will now work everywhere, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said his previous attempt at replacing TinyMCE lasted approximately two years and they never ended up shipping it. Getting Gutenberg off the ground at this time allows WordPress to take the best of what competitors in both open source and commercial spaces have been doing, and improve upon it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium started five or six years ago,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Browser technology, what you can do, has advanced quite a bit. I think this actually allows us to leapfrog past some of the really great visual editors, because we&#8217;re able to build on the shoulders of things like Medium, Wix, Squarespace, and others that have come before us.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg First Impressions and Concerns</h3>\n<p>The Gutenberg plugin is now active on more than 300 sites and first impressions are rolling in. This is the first time the new block editor has been easily accessible to any user who wants to try it. Gutenberg also offers a somewhat unique testing experience in that it creates its own menu inside WordPress, so users don&#8217;t have to choose between the old editor and the new one. Activating Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t make it an either/or experience and users can test at their own convenience.</p>\n<p>From my initial testing, I found that Gutenberg provides a clean and enjoyable experience. Up until this point many of us couldn&#8217;t fully anticipate what Gutenberg would look like, but the interface is very similar to what one might imagine for an improved &#8220;distraction-free writing experience.&#8221; Gutenberg provides a more minimal UI for both the visual and text editors, although inserting blocks seems to be less functional when using the text editor.</p>\n<p>There are still many bugs and rough edges, but this interface appears to be a natural evolution of WordPress&#8217; content editing experience. It <em>feels</em> like WordPress. The editor pulls in many of the elements that have worked well historically and introduces a minimal UI that makes it possible for anyone to build a beautiful, feature-rich post without knowing any HTML. Gutenberg is the most exciting thing to happen to WordPress in a long time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The default state is likely my favorite &#8216;Distraction Free Writing&#8217; implementation in WordPress yet,&#8221; WordPress core committer Aaron Jorbin said in <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">a post listing his initial observations</a>.  I’m simultaneously able to focus on my content, and yet I have all the tools I need for writing. I don’t have all the tools I need for content creation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matt Cromwell, co-author of GiveWP, also wrote up his <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\">first impressions of Gutenberg</a> with high compliments for the new writing experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In recent years we’ve seen Medium become the de facto elegant writing experience,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Medium is able to do that though by limiting the formatting and layout options dramatically. Gutenberg has the potential to allow writing to be as elegant as Medium or more so, plus deliver far more flexibility with layouts and content types.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One area of uncertainty for WordPress developers is how Gutenberg will handle support for plugins and maintain a high level of performance with a large number of custom blocks added.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\'ll try again when it has support for plugins. I can\'t see this landing in core if it doesn\'t work with plugins.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Josh Pollock (@Josh412) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Josh412/status/877913290063663109\">June 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It *should* store the block data as JSON (or serialized object, IDC) into postmeta, but instead it uses regexp to parse HTML and queries DB.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Christian Nikkanen (@k1sul1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/k1sul1/status/877945432889884672\">June 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;I miss a lot of the meta boxes I’m used to seeing on the screen,&#8221; Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;Things like Yoast SEO (on some sites) and custom taxonomies are just not shown. If every metabox ever made for WordPress needs to be remade, it sure is going to make developers&#8217; lives a living hell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matt Cromwell also detailed a nightmare scenario of having more custom blocks than the current UI can handle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What happens when you have 25 plugins that all want to load 25 custom blocks into that tiny &#8216;Insert&#8217; dropdown?&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Will there be a search? Or will it just scroll forever?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg specifically addressed some of these concerns in his Q&amp;A session at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people have a lot of things built into the edit screen, so part of the reason we&#8217;re putting it out there as a plugin first and also pushing it so hard to get as many people to install it as possible, is so that everyone who has posting and editing screen adjustments can rethink them to be beautiful within this new framework,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg anticipates that WordPress will release version 4.9 before merging Gutenberg, because he wants to see it tested on more than 100,000 sites before replacing the edit screen. If all goes well, the new editor could land in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that some things that people did, like TinyMCE toolbar things, aren&#8217;t really needed any more,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Stuff that people did in the past with custom post types might be better as blocks. It gives us a real opportunity to reimagine a lot of the user interactions and flows that today we&#8217;ve taken for granted on the edit screen for five or six years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out Mullenweg&#8217;s WCEU 2017 interview below to see the live demo of Gutenberg and make sure to take a few minutes to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">install the plugin</a> to see it in action for yourself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 22:29:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Post Status: The future of the WordPress economy, and why I’m not worried\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=37734\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://poststatus.com/future-wordpress-economy-im-not-worried/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13965:\"<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: This is a guest post by Joshua Strebel, the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://pagely.com\">Pagely</a>.

And if you like this post, you&#8217;ll also enjoy <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/publish\">Post Status Publish</a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>There’s been some <a href=\"http://chrislema.com/wordpress-economy-shrinking/\">recent speculation</a> on whether or not the WordPress economy is beginning to slump. I would answer &#8216;yes&#8217; and &#8216;no&#8217;; it <em>is</em> clearly evolving, and some areas are contracting while others are growing. I believe we are feeling the effects of<strong> </strong><b>market maturity</b>.</p>\n<p>Are downmarket “one stop shop” alternatives and in house teams the best solution for the future of WordPress? No, because hosting providers, developers, and agencies who specialize in this space are where the concentrated real quality resides, and people are always willing to pay for quality. Ultimately WordPress has staying power because of its ecosystem, so let’s take stock of that.</p>\n<h2>The current state of the WordPress economy</h2>\n<p>In 2017 WordPress is used by major publishers, enterprises, <a href=\"https://pagely.com/solutions/universities/\">universities</a> and even custom SaaS applications. In fact the world’s leaders in business and marketing trends use WordPress (and aren’t necessarily leveraging in house teams to do so). To name a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/\">Facebook Newsroom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gv.com/\">Google Ventures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/\">Mercedes Benz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/\">Bloomberg Professional</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress powers an estimated <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/features/\">28% of all websites</a> which run the gamut of single contributor blogs and simple websites to applications and complex portals. That’s nearly 75 million websites built by anyone from the very beginner to the professional with an extremely advanced level of technical skill. WordPress is both easy to use and graceful in its complex abilities to do just about anything you would need a website to do.</p>\n<p>There’s also the community behind WordPress, an ecosystem of people around the world with this one thing in common. As an <a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/2017/05/citizen-guide-open-source-community/\">open source community</a>, our entire industry is plugged into every update. We can contribute to testing or code. We have all the power to make sure the WordPress economy stays strong and continues to grow.</p>\n<p>New businesses are constantly being formed around plugins, themes and services built specifically for WordPress, with no signs of stopping. In fact, we’ll continue to find more and more creators of WordPress specific companies, with full time jobs elsewhere, using this as an opportunity to contribute to the community.</p>\n<p class=\"lead txt-danger\">However, the near constant flow of new entries into an already saturated market is outstripping demand. The WordPress pie overall is still growing but not quick enough to absorb the new sellers entering into the lower third of the market. The new players are typically unable to challenge the dominant players for a significant market share, and the demands and needs of the customers are also moving up the value chain. Yes, some newcomers do disrupt the established WP players, but it is happening with less frequency, and the barrier is ever higher.</p>\n<h2>Economies ebb and flow: Apple and Airbnb (and WordPress)</h2>\n<p>The companies and brands that have changed the way people live experience low points. Just like the ones we’ve feared will appear in our own industry. But you know these companies well, and they and their economies have persevered.</p>\n<p>Take the classic example, one of the greatest comeback stories of all time: Apple. Apple defied all odds and went from near bankruptcy to the powerhouse hardware leader it is today with over one billion iPhones currently in use. They lost Steve Jobs and many feared they would lose their focus and tumble downward. Instead they’re the <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/05/five-years-after-steve-jobs-an-apple-with-the-courage-to-say-no\">largest and most profitable</a> they’ve ever been. Walk down the streets of New York City or San Francisco and you’ll see brick and mortar shops dedicated to alt-genius-bar services and shattered screen replacement. The Apple economy is strong.</p>\n<p>Just like Apple, Airbnb almost flopped, but came out on top. It has an ecosystem of its own with tons of offshoot companies that support various aspects of the community, just like WordPress. After near failure Airbnb now supports a community of over 100 million and is valued at over $30 billion. They also face <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-11/airbnb-faces-growing-pains-as-it-passes-100-million-users\">growing pains</a> and — at times — volatility, but companies like this — the ones that fundamentally change the way the world works — aren’t going anywhere.</p>\n<p>WordPress itself isn’t in danger of a near flop, but these are valuable examples of economies that fared far worse and still made it through.</p>\n<h2>The core strengths of WordPress</h2>\n<p>WordPress possesses fundamental characteristics that so many of today’s great leaders encompass. All leaders like this are built to support a growing economy for a long time to come.</p>\n<h3>Brand</h3>\n<p>In Pagely&#8217;s own recent user survey, the most important factors for choosing a service were <strong>reliability </strong>and <strong>security</strong>. These are cornerstones of the WordPress brand <em>(haters gonna hate – but core has been really solid for many years in both respects)</em> and reasons why such a large percentage of the internet continues to choose it to power their websites. As a brand, WordPress is synonymous with being one of the most reliable and secure CMS options available. Quality service providers that support WordPress, like Pagely, also often encompass these brand characteristics. We often hear of these same characteristics as pain points from customers trying to work in-house or with downmarket alternatives.</p>\n<h3>Ubiquity</h3>\n<p>WordPress users span nearly every industry in the world. Publishers, Fortune 500 Companies, Music, Fashion, Tech, Politics, you name it. Like I mentioned above, ~75 million websites use WordPress, and they are published in dozens of languages. WordPress is literally a web that has woven itself through the digital and physical world.</p>\n<h3>Community</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community is made up of contributors, coders, engineers, designers, marketing professionals, and every other title necessary to run a business. The community reaches so far that it touches every corner of today’s tech workforce. Not only is the community large, but it cares. We care. The number of blogs and forums dedicated to helping people understand WordPress are impossible to count. Events like WordCamp, LoopConf, Publish, and PressNomics occur all year long and prominent core contributors participate. Don’t hate me for loosely quoting Lincoln. But, it could be said here that “[WordPress] of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”</p>\n<h2>The WordPress ecosystem rewards quality</h2>\n<p>While the core strengths of WordPress support the service itself, quality is what supports the economy as a whole. And the fact remains that people <em>are</em> willing to pay for quality. To paint the picture, at Pagely a core aspect of our mission is to bring a flexible, friendly, and first-rate experience to all our customers. In staying true to that high standard of quality we’ve seen substantial <a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/2017/01/pagely-2016-in-review/\">year over year revenue growth since 2014</a>. With an ecosystem that strives for and rewards quality, the larger WordPress economy is in a position to keep growing — and continue to take us along with it.</p>\n<p>Any &#8220;economy&#8221; will ebb and flow, but when a technology powers 28% of something, it has staying power; WordPress and the ecosystem we’ve built around it isn’t going anywhere, <strong>but it is changing</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The ecosystem is maturing — and growing</h2>\n<p>I would argue that after 12+ years the WordPress ecosystem has firmly moved from &#8220;<strong>New market</strong>&#8221; territory where there were wide open spaces for entrants to dominate. As an example, commercial themes really took off in 2008,  managed WordPress hosting came to prominence in 2010, and commercial plugins rose to fame in 2011. These, and most channels in the ecosystem are now clearly defined &#8220;<strong>Existing markets</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since 2015 or so, the majors players in each category have been well known, with few exceptions from new entrants claiming significant market share. <strong>Those who are doing this are using <a href=\"https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/the-four-types-of-market-market-maturity-where-does-your-startups-product-belong/\">strategies</a> common in existing markets: Resegmentation based on price, and resegmentation based on a niche strategy.</strong></p>\n<p>Borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/karl-and-bill/6-signs-your-market-is-maturing.html\">this article</a>, we can identify six signs a market is maturing. Not every point applies completely to our ecosystem, but enough do that I believe we can safely make this call.</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"mb-1\">Customer needs/desires do not appear to be evolving rapidly.<br />\n– <small class=\"txt-danger\">eCommerce and membership sites are the most recent ‘asks’ that come to mind, and that was a few years ago.</small></li>\n<li class=\"mb-1\">Consolidation by leading competitors is reducing competitive intensity.<br />\n– <small class=\"txt-danger\">GoDaddy, EIG, Envato, and Automattic are rapidly consolidating products and services into their domain</small>.</li>\n<li class=\"mb-1\">Disruptive innovations and new entrants are gaining share only gradually and top out at relatively low levels.<br />\n– <small class=\"txt-danger\">Some really innovative things are happening, but they&#8217;re around the corner and seem slow to pick up traction.</small></li>\n<li class=\"mb-1\">Market shares of leading competitors have solidified and are changing gradually, if at all.<br />\n– <small class=\"txt-danger\">We pretty much know who the leaders are in every category and the price points they own.</small></li>\n<li class=\"mb-1\">Price, brand, and/or channel strategy have supplanted product innovation as key value drivers.<br />\n– <small class=\"txt-danger\">Refining the value proposition to our customers has greater focus at Pagely vs. shipping the latest tech du jour, which is happening just behind the scenes at measured pace.</small></li>\n<li class=\"mb-1\">Cash flows are increasingly turning positive and being returned to investors rather than invested into the market.<br />\n– <small class=\"txt-danger\">Not in all cases, there is still a lot of energy being focused on market expansion.</small></li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"pullquote alignright\">The pie is still growing overall, but a higher percentage of that growth is being concentrated among the established leaders who do more than the basics.</span>\n<p>The massive low-cost hosting providers are enrolling many thousands of new WordPress users a day. Their product offering is good enough for the price point, their marketing spends are huge, and any new customer starting to use WordPress is landing there.</p>\n<p>It is the same with eCommerce on WordPress — there are just two or three plugins and services absorbing new users.</p>\n<p>In the agency space, the buyers willing to spend capital (enough to sustain a high-end WordPress agency) on WordPress solutions are not buying $500 websites, or $5,000 websites as they once were. They are buying $50K-$1M custom-built WordPress backed applications. The resources and talent required to serve these clients is concentrated at a handful of established and well known shops.</p>\n<p>These examples continue into every segment of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>WordPress is getting easier and easier to use right out of the box. If the majority of the new WordPress users needs are solved on install (via core, bundled plugins, or the hosting platform) then a wide swath of the current ecosystem is going to shrink.</p>\n<p><strong>In all channels, new market entrants or existing small shops are being out-gunned by the established players, or the buyers needs are being met upon install.</strong></p>\n<h2>Adapt to win</h2>\n<p>So is the WordPress ecosystem shrinking? <strong>Yes, segments of it are and will continue to do so</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s like in any industry: the car replaced the horse and the robot replaced the factory worker. What was successful in the New Market phase may not work in the more mature, &#8220;Existing Market&#8221; phase we are in.</p>\n<p><strong> Other segments, many not even identified yet, will expand.</strong> There are still big challenges that need to be solved in WordPress, the solutions for which will surely prove to be innovative and profitable. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491\">Go find the next blue ocean</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 22:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Joshua Strebel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: WordPress Marketing Team Launches Case Studies and Usage Survey for Agencies, Clients, and Enterprises\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71973\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-marketing-team-launches-case-studies-and-usage-survey-for-agencies-clients-and-enterprises\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5563:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/survey.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/FI3UYVGNFD\">Lukasz Kowalewski</a>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Marketing Team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">launched a set of surveys</a> to gather case studies and usage data from agencies, clients, and enterprises, with the goal of providing more resources for adoption.

These research surveys are one of the first steps in that direction, along with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-proposes-wordpress-growth-council\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Growth Council</a> that Mullenweg formed to bring together more people with large-scale marketing expertise.</p>\n<p>With the proliferation of user-friendly, DIY commercial website solutions, WordPress has reached a critical time where the project needs to shed its image as a clunky, legacy CMS and demonstrate why it&#8217;s the market leader. This not only requires WordPress to deliver from a technical standpoint, especially in the areas of editing and customization, but also requires the 14-year-old project to step up its marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Marketing Team exists to &#8220;help people market WordPress as open source software and the WordPress community.&#8221; The need is evident, as even the most experienced WordPress professionals struggle to properly articulate the difference between WordPress.com and the self-hosted software in a way that newcomers can understand. This is an intractable marketing problem for the self-hosted community.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Explain to me in two paragraphs or less the delineation between <a href=\"https://t.co/shm7MBBfUi\">https://t.co/shm7MBBfUi</a>, Jetpack, and <a href=\"https://t.co/w3VOMjx5s9\">https://t.co/w3VOMjx5s9</a>.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ryan D.

This twosome drives the project and sometimes it drives us crazy—only because it instills wide-eyed confusion trying to explain these companion entities to the rest of the world. Simple enough: get a free blog at .COM or get free software and help at .ORG. However, free software makes no sense to the average person, and too many writers, marketers, and designers don’t much care how the InterWebs actually operate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The confusion between WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress is just one of the many factors that make the software a unique marketing challenge. <a href=\"http://devwp.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Mario Peshev</a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://devrix.com\" target=\"_blank\">DevriX</a>, identified many more <a href=\"http://devwp.eu/15-obstacles-enterprises-report-wordpress-development-partners/\" target=\"_blank\">obstacles that enterprises find in using WordPress</a>.

That\'s powerful.\" /><h3>So you make websites, right?</h3>\n<p>My name’s Juan and I make websites. I’ve been doing that since my brother came home with a computer’s magazine that had a CD with a copy of Front Page 98. I learned about HTML. Tables. Marquees. Divs. CSS. Flash. ActionScript. JavaScript. PHP-Nuke. phpBB. Blogger. And, finally, in 2008, I learned about WordPress.</p>\n<p>I loved writing and enjoyed having my own blog after seeing that social networks like MySpace or Fotolog weren’t going too far. I kept learning and found the power of WordPress to create more complex sites. I decided that my hobby could be my job. I became a freelancer. I found clients, I made lots of mistakes, I didn’t make much money. I was alone in my small village in the North of Spain: Santoña, in Cantabria.</p>\n<p>I knew I wasn’t the only one creating websites around, but I never thought about meeting people like me. I didn’t know about the real power of Open Source. I was isolated, planning to move with my girlfriend to another city, Pontevedra, and I didn’t have a clue about what was going to happen soon in my life.</p>\n<h3>The power of WordCamps</h3>\n<p>One day I found out that in November of 2015 there was going to be a WordCamp in Santander, a city 50 km. far from my village. An event for WordPress developers and users. That sounded good. I had no idea that that kind of events were happening all around the world. I had no idea about anything related to the WordPress Community. I didn’t know that the Community was even a thing.</p>\n<p>So I went there a Saturday morning and attended to most of the talks.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I remember sitting in the last rows, as if I were hiding so no one would notice that I was there alone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t want to say anything stupid and I was just absorbing all I could from the speakers and their presentations.</p>\n<p>After a great talk about theme development I waited for the speaker and I thanked him for all the info. I was nervous. He was a speaker. He was from another league, right? But he was a really nice guy, ‘if you have any doubt, just ask me’. Cool.</p>\n<p>On Sunday we had the Contributor’s Day. And there I was, randomly in the Community table, learning how to organize a Meetup with some people I had just met, Rocío Valdivia and Ibon Azkoitia. Remember these names. They told me that, as I was moving to another city where there wasn’t any WordPress group, I could start one myself.</p>\n<p>My brain: Wait a second. Me? Starting a WordPress Meetup in Pontevedra?</p>\n<p>I took notes and kept enjoying the day. I met many people and, being not very good remembering names, all I could do was following them on Twitter. And signing in the WP Slack channel.</p>\n<p>At the end of the event, Darío, the main organizer asked me about how was the experience. I had loved it. Will you come back? Yeah, but next year… as a speaker!</p>\n<p>My brain, again: As a speaker? Are you really listening to yourself? You hate speaking in public. You’re the most nervous person ever.</p>\n<h3>My first year in the Spanish WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>The days after the event were weird. I started reading about the people I met and I found out that some of them were incredible developers, some of them had thousands of followers in Twitter, some of them had the most important websites about WordPress in our language… And I didn’t have a clue about all that.</p>\n<p>Did it matter? Not at all. These people don’t care about those things and will help you no matter who you are or where you are coming from.</p>\n<p>Moving to a new place was a slow process, so I didn’t have to worry about the Meetup I promised to organize, but the weeks were running and I had no idea about what to talk about in the next WordCamp as I told Darío.</p>\n<p>I started to become a little more involved in the Community. I helped translating plugins to Spanish. The original translation of WooCommerce was made by a drunk robot or similar, so there were thousands of strings to be revised and translated again. It was fun. And a lot of work that I did with the help of Fernando Tellado, an experienced translator and member of the Community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And I was helping hundreds of people that were using WordPress for their businesses. That’s powerful. I was helping many people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By that time I was reading many WordPress related blogs and sites and I decided to curate a weekly post with the ten best links (in Spanish and English) I read every week. That’s how I started Enlace Permanente, which is almost now in its #70 edition with many subscribers to the newsletter and followers.</p>\n<p>I kept talking with Ibon, Darío and others in the Slack channels and on September of 2016 we decided to go to WordCamp Seville. I travelled the country from North to South and spent there a fantastic weekend. I shared an AirBnb apartment with Ibon, Mauricio Gelves and Fernan Díez, who became great friends. I met more new people and strengthened the relationship with ‘older’ mates.</p>\n<p>And, as I was finally moving to a new flat in Pontevedra, I decided it was time to start the local Community of the city. A city where I didn’t know any other developer or WordPress user. But… I was sure someone will be there.</p>\n<p>I had the help of Rocío, who works at Automattic and all her time is donated to the WordPress.org Community team, working at WordCamp Central helping Meetup and WordCamp organizers all around the world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>She was extremely helpful and she’s the reason that today in Spain we have more than 40 different Meetups and 5 WordCamps in 2017.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I planned the first event for the end of November, but before, I had to send an email to Darío as the Call for Speakers of WordCamp Santander 2016 was already open. I decided to talk about my experience the last year. ‘From being no one to being a speaker: a year in the Spanish WordPress Community’. That was the title of my talk.</p>\n<p>And yes, I was nervous. I didn’t sleep well the week before. I talked quickly. But I did it. People laughed, people clapped and people enjoyed my story. This story. And they learned about how they could help an awesome Open Source project like WordPress and meet great people at the same time.</p>\n<h3>Becoming a known member of the Community</h3>\n<p>When you become part of a Community for the first time, you easily find that there are small groups within the big one. People that already know each other of past events, of past projects. And maybe you think that it’s not easy to be part of those groups. Or that they won’t accept a new one.</p>\n<p>Well, that didn’t happen to me in the WordPress Community.</p>\n<p>Everyone was ready to say ‘hi’ to the latest addition. Everyone was ready to help with translation doubts. Everyone was ready to share their experience organizing local groups. Or answering questions in the support forums. Or just ready to chit chat. Or to organize a trip for the next WordCamp.</p>\n<p>So I just started doing the same.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And you don’t do it to become a known member of the Community. That’s just a catchy phrase for the post. You do it because it feels good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because you meet great developers, designers, freelancers… Because you can help anyone who knows a little less than you, the same way that the people that know more help you.</p>\n<p>In 2017 I was lucky enough to be part of WordCamp Madrid and WordCamp Bilbao, as a volunteer and as a speaker. I had the chance to talk about something that I’m really passionate in Madrid: the open web. I had the chance to speak up about net neutrality, about our contents, about walled gardens, about what we can do to save the web. I shared an important message with my peers.</p>\n<p>And in Bilbao I had the chance to explain the process of creating a WordPress theme from the moment the designer starts wireframing a project. My day to day job. Best practices, advice, tools, how-tos… I showed how I do my job to become better at it and to help others to become better too.</p>\n<p>Also in Pontevedra, we’re around 20-25 people every month in the local Meetup. And in Galicia, the region where I live, I’ve helped creating two more Meetup groups, in Ourense &amp; Lugo. And I’m sure there will be more soon! There are almost 3 million people here, so many WordPress users still to find!</p>\n<h3>And what now?</h3>\n<p>I want to keep having fun and working to make WordPress a better tool and platform for as many people as possible. I want to find more people in the local communities to show them what we have here. And who knows? Maybe organizing a WordCamp in 2018.</p>\n<p>Also, in the next months I would like to find out if it’s possible also to become a more active member of the Global WordPress Community. As English is not our first language and we’re a little shy, probably not many Spanish speakers are known in the WP world. But I’m sure that the steps I did to become part of our national group can be done exactly the same way to be part of the international one, don’t you think?</p>\n<p>So, who knows?

Instead, they are now paying full-price.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/blog/\">WooCommerce blog</a> and the official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/woocommerce\">Twitter account</a> do not mention anything about the price increase.</p>\n<p>We contacted Automattic and asked if the discount was removed and if customers received prior notice of the price increase. Todd Wilkens, head of WooCommerce, provided the Tavern with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All customers receive notification of their upcoming renewal 7 or 15 days before a charge. If anyone received an incorrect price, please contact us immediately and we will make it right. As always, we are committed to making sure WooCommerce is affordable to the widest range of people while maintaining our high level of service and support.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A customer upset by the change contacted WooCommerce&#8217;s support desk and inquired about the price increase. The support representative confirmed that the discount was removed and that customers will need to pay full-price to renew.</p>\n<p>The customer service rep also explained that the change is due to WooCommerce moving to a straight renewal process, similar to other SaaS products. The representative concludes the ticket by saying they&#8217;re monitoring and accepting feedback about the change.</p>\n<img />WooCommerce Customer Support Response\n<p>Nathan Hadsall, who makes a living using WooCommerce, is among those upset by the change. &#8220;I have been a huge WooCommerce supporter and most of my work as a developer is spent working with WooCommerce,&#8221; Hadsall said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However this type of approach to business is very sad. I have no problem paying for a license despite the fact that GPL software is available cheaper and legally/ethically by other means.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will still stick to WooCommerce since the core is fantastic and is getting better. The biggest change for me will be the plugins and code I use to extend WooCommerce functionality. I will probably start to look elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest gripe I have is with the way WooCommerce does business. WooCommerce has never seemed to care about their customers. Slipping this pricing change in was not an honest move.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Raising prices for renewals is a part of business and something I think many customers expect at some point. However, raising prices on subscriptions that existing customers may have set to auto-renew, without explicitly notifying them about the change, can create a negative, lasting experience.</p>\n<p>If you purchased a subscription on WooCommerce.com and have set it to auto-renew, keep a close eye for your renewal notice.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 02:56:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Disqus 3.0 Beta Improves Comment Syncing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72176\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://wptavern.com/disqus-3-0-beta-improves-comment-syncing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2195:\"<p>When <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-269-interview-with-daniel-ha-ceo-and-co-founder-of-disqus\">we interviewed</a> Daniel Ha, CEO and co-founder of Disqus, earlier this year, he explained why some users were <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-269-interview-with-daniel-ha-ceo-and-co-founder-of-disqus#comment-216978\">reporting problems</a> syncing comments between Disqus and WordPress and that improvements would be coming soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We may have taken some services offline to work on them which may have affected those who were trying to sync,&#8221; Ha said.</p>\n<p>Disqus <a href=\"https://blog.disqus.com/disqus-for-wordpress-3.0-plugin-beta-now-available-for-testing\">has released</a> 3.0 Beta 1 that fixes syncing issues and introduces a redesigned settings screen.

Traditionally, WordCamp contributor days are held on Sunday after the main event, the day following the after party when many who signed up struggle to make it on time &#8211; or at all. WordCamp Europe attendees generally appreciated having the contributor day scheduled before the main conference and the higher attendance numbers demonstrate the success of this arrangement.</p>\n<p>The after party featured a 1930&#8217;s theme at the Pavillon d’Armenonville.

Rebecca is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/\">Web Savvy Marketing</a>, a web development, design, maintenance, and SEO consulting company based in Michigan and host of the <a href=\"https://www.seobits.fm/\">SEO Bits podcast</a>.</p>\n<p>Rebecca recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/9seeds-acquires-web-savvy-marketings-genesis-theme-store\">sold her Genesis Theme store to 9seeds</a>, a store she managed and maintained for five years. In this post, she shares ten lessons learned from selling WordPress products.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When <a href=\"https://wanderingjon.com/\">Jon Brown</a> and I started talking about Web Savvy Marketing selling its theme store to 9seeds, it became abundantly clear that I wasn’t just selling him a portfolio of Genesis child themes. Anybody can do that. What I was really selling him was an established process and five long years of making mistakes and creating solutions.</p>\n<p>When I launched our theme store and stepped into the world of developing WordPress products, I was beyond naïve. I had no idea what I was getting myself into and I didn’t know how to run a successful e-commerce business.</p>\n<p>But after a lot of mistakes and course corrections, I found stability, a lot of great customers, and more revenue than I expected.</p>\n<p>Today, I&#8217;m sharing my top 10 lessons learned with you, so I can spare you from falling down the same rabbit holes and pitfalls.</p>\n<h2>My 10 Lessons Learned</h2>\n<h3>Reputation Is Everything</h3>\n<p>I didn’t set up out to create a strong reputation and I honestly didn’t know I was doing it. I was just following the rules given to me by my Grandmother and the basics of business I learned while working for my prior employers.</p>\n<p>What I realized was this – having a strong reputation helps you sell, but it also helps keep you out of hot water when things don’t go as you plan. People are more willing to buy from you, become your brand advocates, and forgive you when you make a mistake.</p>\n<h3>A Strong FAQ Page Is Worth Its Weight in Gold</h3>\n<p>I didn’t see this as a necessary page at first, but once I had the same question asked 100 times, I realized I needed to have an easily accessible page that answered common questions. Our comprehensive FAQ page has saved me time, but it also aided in sales. Visitors receive immediate answers to their questions and they are more inclined to hit the buy button while you still have their attention and interest.</p>\n<h3>Thorough Post-sale Communication Is a Requirement</h3>\n<p>During the first year of our store opening, I was flooded with post-sale emails and inquiries. No one was using our support forum and the option of self-service. I was so annoyed and frustrated it wasn’t even funny. And then something happened.</p>\n<p>I realized it wasn’t the buyers’ fault. I realized it was my fault. I had failed to communicate, provide next steps, and set expectations. Once I took ownership over this issue, I created a follow-up sequence that provided post-purchase instructions on where to go and what to do.</p>\n<p>A magical thing happened – or many things actually. I freed up my time because people stopped emailing me and I had happy customers who actually thanked me for all the great follow-up information. That was a win/win if there ever was one.</p>\n<h3>Email Templates Save Oodles of Time</h3>\n<p>Even with my stellar FAQ page and follow-up emails, I still received inquiries from people who asked similar questions. I learned to create email templates for anything I had to answer more than five times. This reduced my response time from five minutes to thirty seconds. This freed up my time and more importantly, it gave faster responses to my customers, so they were happy.</p>\n<h3>Create Systems to Save Sanity</h3>\n<p>I’m slightly <span class=\"st\">obsessive-compulsive</span> and I used this to our advantage with the theme store. I created project templates for any new theme launch and I mimicked the same type of tight structure I have with large custom website builds.</p>\n<p>We had a template full of to-do items, ownership of tasks, and expected turn around times. This made the design, coding, and launch of a theme very systematic. This in turn translated to faster product launches, fewer mistakes, and a reduction in development costs.</p>\n<h3>Strong SEO Is Your Friend</h3>\n<p>I could not have been successful without search engine optimization. I let SEO lead the way for what we would sell, who we would sell it to, and how we would market the final product. Strong SEO helped me select the right themes to develop, get quick sales, and cover my development costs within a few months of each launch.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Is a Time Suck but Worth Every Minute Invested</h3>\n<p>I have a love/hate relationship with social media. I hate that it takes so much time and it can be so emotionally draining. At the same time, I love that it helps you reach customers around the world and it supports the SEO process. Social media was a life raft in many ways and I don’t think the store or sales would have grown without it.</p>\n<h3>If Things Can Go Wrong, They Will Go Wrong</h3>\n<p>I have felt like this has been the norm for us this last year. Hosting, plugins, payment gateways, and third-party software sites have worn me out. And I’ve had a team to fix everything. You have to expect things to fail and you must have a plan to fix them quickly. It’s the nature of life and business. Learn to deal with issues quickly and to address one thing at a time.</p>\n<h3>Grace Goes a Long Way in Diffusing Bad Situations</h3>\n<p>No matter how hard you try and how hard you work, your customers will have bad days. When that happens you might receive the brunt of their emotions. This is called &#8216;transference&#8217; and in most cases it has nothing to do with you or your product.</p>\n<p>You have to recognize this for what it is and handle it with grace. Close your email, walk away from your desk, or do whatever you have to do to not reply in anger. Instead, you need to let the moment pass so you can reply calmly and with grace. In each situation where I&#8217;ve used this tactic, I’ve had the crazy person reply with an apology, tell me they were having a really bad day, and then thank me for keeping my calm.</p>\n<h3>People Will Steal Your Products, So Try Not to Take It Personally</h3>\n<p>People will steal your work and your products. You’ll find your premium digital products sitting for download on forums and it will break your heart. Don’t let it. Address the situation and move on. Don’t let someone else’s bad juju ruin your mood, day, or momentum. It won’t help the situation and it will drive you crazy if you let it.</p>\n<h2>In Hindsight</h2>\n<p>I loved launching and owning our theme store. I didn’t sell it because I hated it or because it wasn’t profitable. I sold it because it was no longer the best fit for our company and me personally, which meant it wasn’t going to service our customers as it should.</p>\n<p>If I had the opportunity to do things over, I would still launch and I’d follow the same path I did over the last five years.</p>\n<p>The theme store brought me some wonderful employees, great online friends, and it brought me deeper into the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Selling the store was a hard decision, but the right one. In my heart, I knew I wanted to focus the company more on custom development and I wanted to spend more time with my SEO courses and my <a href=\"https://www.seobits.fm/\">new podcast</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re new to WordPress products and you’re considering launching a new product offering, I encourage you to jump in. Learn from my mistakes, but hold on, because you’re in for a wild ride.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 22:36:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: 4.8 and What’s Coming\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47440\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2017/06/4-8-and-whats-coming/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3844:\"<p>Last week <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">we released version 4.8 &#8220;Evans&#8221; of WordPress</a>, as I write this it has had about <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/counter/\">4.8 million downloads</a> already. The release was stable and has been received well, and we were able do the merge and beta <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-8/\">a bit faster</a> than we have before.</p>\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/04/focus-tech-and-design-leads/\">originally wrote about the three focuses for the year</a> (and in <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/12/state-of-the-word-2016/\">the State of the Word</a>) I said releases would be driven by improvements in those three areas, and people in particular are anticipating the new Gutenberg editor, so I wanted to talk a bit about what&#8217;s changed and what I&#8217;ve learned in the past few months that caused us to course correct and do an intermediate 4.8 release, and why there will likely be a 4.9 before Gutenberg comes in.</p>\n<p>Right now the vast majority of effort is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">going into the new editing experience</a>, and the progress has been great, but because we&#8217;re going to use the new editor as the basis for our new customization experience it means that the leads for the customization focus have to wait for Gutenberg to get a bit further along before we can build on that foundation. Mel and Weston took this as an opportunity to think about not just the &#8220;Customizer&#8221;, which is a screen and code base within WP, but really thinking in a user-centric way about what it means to customize a site and they identified a number of low-hanging fruits, areas like widgets where we could have a big user impact with relatively little effort.</p>\n<p>WordPress is littered with little inconsistencies and gaps in the user experience that aren&#8217;t hard to fix, but are hard to notice the 500th time you&#8217;re looking at a screen.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be able to sustain the effort on the editor and still do a meaningful user release in the meantime, but we did, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/16/4-9-and-gutenberg/\">I think we can do it again</a>.</p>\n<p>4.8 also brought in a number of developer and accessibility improvements, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/\">dropping support for old IE versions</a>, but as I mentioned (too harshly) in my <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/13/first-quarter-check-in/\">first quarter check-in</a> there hasn&#8217;t been as much happening on the REST API side of things, but after talking to some folks at WordCamp EU and the community summit before I&#8217;m optimistic about that improving. Something else I didn&#8217;t anticipate was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/12/28/supporting-the-future-of-wp-cli/\">wp-cli coming under the wing of WP.org as an official project</a>, which is huge for developers and people building on WP. (It&#8217;s worth mentioning <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/restful\">wp-cli and REST API work great together</a>.)</p>\n<p>To summarize: The main focus of the editor is going great, customization has been getting improvements shipped to users, the wp-cli has become like the third focus, and I&#8217;m optimistic about REST-based development the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/session/interview-and-qa/\">on stage at WordCamp Europe in Paris tomorrow afternoon</a> doing a Q&amp;A with <a href=\"https://om.co/\">Om Malik</a> and taking audience questions, will also have a few announcements.

The Community Summit was held earlier in the week, lending a strong contingent of veteran contributors to this event, ready to use the short time they had together.</p>\n<p>With a high concentration of WordPress expertise gathered in Paris, WCEU organizers were able to include 13 talks and workshops aimed at enriching contributors. For an event that has always focused on serving diverse communities, it&#8217;s no surprise that many of the contributor projects were focused on growing and improving WordPress through accessibility, internationalization, documentation, and inclusion.</p>\n<h3>WP REST API Team is Writing Docs to Make the API More Approachable to New Users and Contributors</h3>\n<p>WP REST API project co-lead Ryan McCue said their team was concentrated on improving documentation to give developers a better understanding of the REST API infrastructure and how it integrates with the rest of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main thing we&#8217;re trying to work on is documentation for this sort of stuff, because we&#8217;re lacking a lot of documentation around the infrastructure,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;One of the things we don&#8217;t do well is having a way to go from &#8216;I know nothing&#8217; to &#8216;I know this stuff.&#8217; A lot our documentation describes solutions without describing the problem and how you pick a solution.&#8221; Contributors are working on a new set of user guides, which are currently on <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, that will eventually be included in the developer handbook.</p>\n<p>McCue said the next major project is completing work on <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/OAuth2\" target=\"_blank\">OAuth 2</a>, the new authentication method that will allow users to authorize applications to access data on their sites. He anticipates the team will have a &#8220;very workable plugin&#8221; that could be ready for testing within the next six months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to get this sorted if any of the mobile apps are going to use the REST API,&#8221; McCue said. These apps currently use the existing XML-RPC and WordPress.com APIs. Although OAuth hasn&#8217;t been a major focus so far this year, McCue said the team is looking at changing that going forward.</p>\n<h3>Documentation Team is Working Towards Making HelpHub the Go-To Resource for WordPress Support</h3>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordcamp-europe-docs-team.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: WordCamp Europe 2017 Photography Team\n<p>Jon Ang, who helped lead the Documentation team, said they have been focused on writing documentation for new contributors, as well as ensuring current docs are gender neutral and not overly technical so that content writers can understand them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Helping with the project has traditionally been tough, because we don&#8217;t explain how you can get started,&#8221; Ang said. &#8220;We realized this across the entire documentation team. We are great at writing end-user documentation but not great at writing contributor documentation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the major documentation projects they have been working on for the past few years is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/helphub/\" target=\"_blank\">HelpHub</a>, a companion resource to DevHub that will eventually hold all end-user documentation for WordPress. Migration from the codex is complete and the goal is to retire the codex once the project launches. Docs contributors are working towards making HelpHub the first place that users search for assistance before taking to the forums, lifting some of the burden from support volunteers. HelpHub is being designed to be easily searchable, possibly powered by elasticsearch, with inter-connected articles that focus on a single topic with bite-sized content.</p>\n<p>Ang estimates HelpHub is 30% complete in terms of content and 50% in terms of development. The backend is mostly finished and contributors are now working on the frontend. They are also bringing in content experts to write articles on critical topics, such as security. Ang hopes the team can deliver an MVP by the end of this year and finish the project within the next year.</p>\n<h3>Community Team is Working on Redesigning Central.WordCamp.org to be More Useful to the Wider WordPress Community</h3>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordcamp-europe-2017-community-team-contributors.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Community Team Contributors &#8211; photo credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/875328517000617984\">WordCamp Europe 2017 Photography Team</a>\n<p>A segment of Community Team contributors are working on marketing events better to the wider WordPress community that is not as well-connected with news about the project. As redesign of <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">central.wordcamp.org</a> is part of this effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, the feeling is that we are not getting in front of the people who need our information the most,&#8221; Global Community Team member <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephahaden\" target=\"_blank\">Josepha Hayden</a> said. &#8220;Most WordCamps are educational. There is an aspirational aspect to all of them, of course. But the people who could use the information the most are, for example, the people who inherited a WordPress site and don&#8217;t know what to do about that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After reviewing Google Trends to see what people are actually looking for when they get to a WordCamp site, the Community Team found that most visitors are searching for a WordCamp and the year. The only reason they get to the site is because they already know the event is happening.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The deputies we&#8217;ve spoken to in the last year or so have been echoing this feedback that the problem our WordCamp organizers have is they don&#8217;t have any way to get the information out to attendees better,&#8221; Hayden said. &#8220;If you already know about WordCamps, it&#8217;s easy to find your local WordCamp but if you don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Community Team has begun working on a communication and marketing plan that may include things like automated emails or social media campaigns but their first priority is redesigning central.wordCamp.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We realized the first place we need to start is to have a canonical place for them to go,&#8221; Hayden said. &#8220;Central.WordCamp.org was always supposed to be that place but for awhile it had kind of a hybrid audience. We&#8217;re working on identifying the content, who the correct audience is, and what we&#8217;re missing if we want to help somebody who has never heard about any WordPress events.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The discussion around redesigning central.wordcamp.org discussion has been happening for a few years and the team already has a design that was donated. They have the homepage and several other pages complete and hope to have the new site launched by the end of the year.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 00:27:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Lifted, a WordPress Theme and Plugin Shop for the Marijuana Industry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72027\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/lifted-a-wordpress-theme-and-plugin-shop-for-the-marijuana-industry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4731:\"<p><a href=\"https://liftedthemes.com/\">Lifted</a> is a new WordPress theme and plugin company founded by <a href=\"http://baltimoredrew.com/\">Drew Poland</a> that caters to the marijuana industry. I reached out to Poland to learn more about his company, his pricing model, and get his perspective on this space in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to get into the marijuana industry with WordPress plugins and themes?</strong></p>\n<p>Two primary reasons. The first is that, I truly believe in its medicinal use and there&#8217;s more than enough research out to support its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Documentaries like <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/specials/health/medical-marijuana/index.html\">Weed from CNN and Dr.Sanjay Gupta</a> will bring you to tears watching children like Charlotte Figi, who suffer from extreme epilepsy, almost instantly stop the seizures and become functional with the things most of us take for granted like talking and walking.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to watch at times but there are a lot of cases from the extreme ones like end of life and debilitating issues, to everyday pain, stress, and PTSD management that make it a valuable alternative to harder, more addictive prescription drugs like Opioids, that are most commonly thrown at these as a solution.</p>\n<p>The second reason is less inspiring. It&#8217;s simply a budding industry with massive room for growth. It&#8217;s really just now coming around and I think will accelerate as it matures and the path will become clearer in terms of what clients need and want. An entire new industry has opened.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the technologies used to power your themes?</strong></p>\n<p>Everything is built the WordPress way so everyday users can for the most part, activate a theme and go. For the most part, its page templates, widgets, and some custom fields. If a user is comfortable with those than they can easily use a theme from Lifted.</p>\n<p><strong>Are your themes and plugins GPL licensed or GPL compatible?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely! Everything is 100% GPL licensed.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you determine the price range for Grape Ape $129.99-$379.99 and can you provide an ETA on when it might be released? (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen pre-orders for a theme before)</strong></p>\n<img />Front page of the Grape Ape Theme\n<p>I simply wanted to come in with a product priced on the higher end because I&#8217;m a firm believer that most WordPress products are priced entirely too low.</p>\n<p>I value my time on the highest level since I can&#8217;t make more of it, so a sell low and at volume approach just doesn&#8217;t work for me. I don&#8217;t want to support a $50 theme and the reality is that if this were a custom project for a client, the budget needs to be $10k minimum.</p>\n<p>The estimated release date for Grape Ape is the end of July.</p>\n<p>The pre-order was a result of simply wanting to force myself to get the actual Lifted Themes site up. Otherwise, I would have waited until Grape Ape was complete and then spent entirely too much time on the Lifted site.</p>\n<p>So I had to settle in with a good-looking theme I could live with and later work with my designer to develop something more custom. Had I really wanted to push the pre-order more I would have ramped up marketing months in advance to build up the anticipation and desire for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on your research, how crowded is this space when it comes to WordPress themes and plugins?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say it&#8217;s a clear lane and you can drive as fast or as slow as you like. I have been slow-moving up until this point and had the first marijuana plugin on WordPress.org, so there&#8217;s a lot of room.</p>\n<p>The marijuana industry is also not what I would call mature and at the end of the day there is still a stigma in professional settings. So if you are someone building products on the side or have a lot of clients in a specific industry that isn&#8217;t so receptive, you might not feel comfortable broadcasting that you are working in this space.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any legalities customers should be aware of before using your products?</strong></p>\n<p>If used as intended, no. At its core, Grape Ape is fitted for your typical run of the mill business website, that&#8217;s no different from a coffee shop.</p>\n<p>At the moment, plugins are also in a clear zone. In the future, that may become more of a concern as services and tools are opening their APIs to connect dispensary back office systems with their web presence. That&#8217;s where things start to get tricky, more from a potential patient data view than anything else.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 21:14:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: 9seeds Acquires Web Savvy Marketing’s Genesis Theme Store\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71955\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/9seeds-acquires-web-savvy-marketings-genesis-theme-store\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3761:\"<p><a href=\"https://9seeds.com/\">9seeds</a>, a WordPress development agency <a href=\"https://9seeds.com/the-launch-of-9seeds/\">launched in 2009</a>, has <a href=\"https://9seeds.com/custom-wordpress-development-plugins-genesis-themes/\">acquired</a> Web Savvy Marketing&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/store/\">theme store</a> for an undisclosed amount. <span class=\"st\">Web Savvy Marketing <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2012/03/genesis-child-theme-store/\">launched its theme store</a> in 2012 and currently has a library of 26 themes built on the <a href=\"https://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/\">Genesis Framework</a> by StudioPress. </span></p>\n<img />Web Savvy Marketing Theme Store\n<p><span class=\"st\">Chris Cree who helped launch and manage the theme store in 2012 departed from the company in 2016 and moved overseas to <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2016/07/saying-goodbye-to-chris-cree/\">create a bible school</a>. As the focus of Web Savvy Marketing shifted towards larger custom development projects and SEO, Rebbecca Gill, founder of Web Savvy Marketing, needed to find a way to <a href=\"https://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2017/06/investment-strategy-wsm-selling-genesis-theme-store/\">maintain the theme store</a>. </span></p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted Chris’ vision to live on and I wanted all my babies to continue to flourish and find their way to websites around the world,&#8221; Gill said. &#8220;I was at a crossroads and I didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I needed to make sure the company had a solid long-term strategy, but I also needed to protect our loyal theme customers. Five years of sales meant we had a lot of existing buyers who needed ongoing support.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year, Gill met Jon Brown, owner of 9seeds, and established a professional relationship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very similar views on business, friendships, and ethics,&#8221; Gill said. &#8220;I liked him right away and I knew I wanted to spend more personal and professional time with him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And as we grew closer, we started chatting about my struggles with the theme store and his long-term business goals. Before I knew it, he wanted to acquire the theme store and I wanted to give it to him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>9seeds has built a number of custom sites for clients using the Genesis Framework. For those who wanted to leverage existing themes, the company has often referred clients to Web Savvy Marketing&#8217;s theme store.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It took a bit more time of getting to know each other personally before I came to hold the same feelings that others had shared about her,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I felt deeply that this was a person I not only wanted to be friends with but wanted to be in business with. It became apparent to both of us that this was a perfect fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition brings the themes in-house and expands 9seeds reach into the WordPress products market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a win for 9seeds by giving us a springboard into a market we’ve long had our eye on accompanied by the best trail guide in the business showing us the path,&#8221; Brown said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a win for WSM by freeing Rebecca and her team up to align with where her focus now is on larger custom site builds and SEO consulting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>9seeds is providing support for existing customers and is working on a new theme. The support forums and theme store will migrate to the 9seeds domain later this year.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Brown and his work with 9seeds, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-276-interview-with-jon-brown-a-traveling-digital-nomad\">listen to episode 276</a> of WordPress Weekly.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 19:18:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: An entrepreneurial journey around eCommerce, with Patrick Rauland — Draft Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=37565\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://poststatus.com/entrepreneurial-journey-around-ecommerce-patrick-rauland-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2488:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Through the oddities of life she was never able to do an essay. Recently she told me she would have one soon. This is not that essay. Our contributor this week needed some extra time and Birgit said she had something she wanted to write about, so here it is. Many thanks Birgit.</em></p>\n<p>Something is in the air. Do you feel the WordPress vibrations? It&#8217;s shortly before the fifth WordCamp Europe which will be held in Paris this year. The social channels like Twitter &amp; Co. are flooded with pre-event messages. You can feel the emotions of excitement and sadness in the timeline nearby. People share their excitement about their upcoming attendance and others who can&#8217;t make it. I am a person who belongs to both groups.</p>\n<p>But let me begin some months ago to tell you how this came to be. After WordCamp Europe in Vienna last summer I purchased my ticket for WCEU 2017 in Paris directly after the ticket sale was opened. There was no doubt at all I would participate.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How life&#8217;s play changes, it worked out differently than planned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve struggled with some health issues over several years. Mostly caused by stress during and after the divorce, as well as some deaths in the vicinity. Nothing really serious, but not ignorable. I thought&#8230; But at the end of the summer last year I got seriously ill. Not the right place for details here, but I had to quit my day job in a small agency because the fixed-term employment contract ended at the same time. Also, I had to reduce any contributions to the WordPress project. I had to reduce my freelancing contracts, too.</p>\n<p>I ran from one medical specialist to the other to find the cause of my illness. I was so frustrated not to be able to work like I&#8217;ve done before and so upset about the brain-fog and the fatigue. It was so depressing. As a mom of five children, it is not funny to be ill. The three youngest kids are living at home with me and my new partner. My oldest daughter bought her own house. But I couldn&#8217;t help her while moving. Can you imagine, how frustrating this could be?</p>\n<p>But hey &#8211; I am a fighter like a lioness. I put everything on the plate, invested my small savings into healing treatments and so on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To make a long story short, I am getting healthier every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We found the cause and the healing treatments are helping like expected. Two operations went well. It is a process, but it&#8217;s going forward.</p>\n<p>Sitting at home without a job is not my thing, so I searched for a new day job. I found a part-time employment in my hometown as a head of a tutoring institute. It is ok, but nothing WordPress related. It secures my existence. But my saving balance allowed no budget for WordCamp travels. I gave up thoughts of attending WordCamp Europe in Paris this year.</p>\n<p>So I decided to offer my ticket.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’v to sell my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wceu?src=hash\">#wceu</a> ticket I bought last year. Unless it happens a miracle and there is a sponsor for stay &amp; travel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope\">@WCEurope</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PFWBTtSmlq\">pic.twitter.com/PFWBTtSmlq</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Coach Birgit Olzem (@CoachBirgit) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachBirgit/status/867323301399588864\">May 24, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The unexpected miracle happened. I found sponsors for travel &amp; stay without active seeking. My generous sponsors rewarded my past contributions to WordPress and Community over several years with this openhearted support. I am so grateful for this.</p>\n<p>Since 2012 I have been an active member of the WordPress Community. First as the main responsible person for the translations of WordPress into German, then as a part of the international Polyglots team. I am also editor and release manager for local German site and I am a member of some other contribution teams in the WordPress ecosystem. I spent a lot of spare time and money on contributions and WordCamp travels.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perhaps you can imagine how frustrating it was, that I couldn&#8217;t afford to travel to WordCamp Europe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An event where I can meet a lot of friends I made over the last years. Even more, I was happy to get the generous sponsoring. I am so grateful!</p>\n<p>In the last two years I had to reduce my contribution time and disappeared from the scene, but I followed the changes and enhancements within the community in the background. Nevertheless I wasn&#8217;t forgotten.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s not only me who get help to attend to WCEU:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today is a completely different day. Largely thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk\">@jdevalk</a> (and team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoast\">@yoast</a> ) I WILL be attending. Beyond grateful is what I am.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Remkus de Vries (@DeFries) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeFries/status/874595421112414208\">June 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Everyone has had some downs and some ups. If you ask, there is always someone who is willing to help you. It is an example of a mindset from an open-source community like the WordPress community and it reflects the philosophy. You can get everything, but you have to ask. Only speaking people can be helped.</p>\n<p>Apropos speaking people can get helped:</p>\n<p>I have a dream over some years to contribute to WordPress in full-time as a WordPress Community Manager. There are so many things I can do even if I am not a full-stack developer. Perhaps this miracle happens, too. But at this moment I am sitting on my suitcases to write about the generosity in the WordPress Community. This essay wasn&#8217;t planned, but it happened to have been written.</p>\n<p>I am so grateful for my heroes who made it happen, that I can go to the WordCamp Europe this year.</p>\n<p>There are so many unseen heroes outside who need to be seen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Be open minded, trust yourself and talk about what matters to you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Be your own hero.</p>\n<p>Beyond everything else: Care about yourself!</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Trust Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Trust%20Yourself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ftrust-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Trust Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ftrust-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ftrust-yourself%2F&title=Trust+Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Trust Yourself\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/trust-yourself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/061417-150x150.jpg&description=Trust Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Trust Yourself\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/trust-yourself/\" title=\"Trust Yourself\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/trust-yourself/\">Trust Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:00:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Birgit Olzem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Imagely Acquires TeslaThemes, Is Seeking Other Acquisition Opportunities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71716\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/imagely-acquires-teslathemes-is-seeking-other-acquisition-opportunities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4432:\"<p>In an effort to diversify and expand into the commercial WordPress theme market, <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com\">Imagely</a>, maintainers of <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/wordpress-gallery-plugin/\">NextGEN Gallery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/tesla-themes-acquisition/\">have acquired</a> <a href=\"http://teslathemes.com/\">TeslaThemes</a> for an undisclosed amount.</p>\n<p>TeslaThemes <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interview-with-brand-new-theme-club-teslathemes\">launched in 2013</a> as a theme club and recently celebrated its <a href=\"http://teslathemes.com/blog/teslathemes-anniversary-giveaway-and-redesign-announcement/\">fourth anniversary</a>. The company has 68 themes in its library, including the TeslaThemes framework.</p>\n<p>Eric Danzer, Founder and CEO of Imagely, says no major changes will be happening with TeslaThemes and that their immediate focus will be to provide maintenance and support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond that, our goal is to do more of what Tesla has already been doing so well &#8211; creating beautiful new themes and continually enhancing the existing themes,&#8221; Danzer said.</p>\n<p>Imagely has been busy this year launching a <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/websites/\">managed WordPress hosting service</a> for photographers, releasing <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/wordpress-photography-themes/\">new photography themes</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/wordpress-lightroom-plugin/\">Adobe Lightroom plugin</a> that allows users to manage NextGEN galleries from within Lightroom.</p>\n<p>Later this year, Imagely plans to release a new version of NextGEN gallery with a redesigned backend interface. The company is also working on a way to add automated print fulfillment to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Automated print fulfillment allows photographers to sell prints from their websites, and have those prints automatically delivered via the print lab without any intervention on their part,&#8221; Danzer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This functionality drives many large companies in the photo industry &#8211; SmugMug, ShootProof, Pixieset, Zenfolio, Photoshelter, and others. But it&#8217;s not possible yet on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bringing a full print solution to WordPress has the potential to revolutionize the photo industry and make WordPress the default web solution for photographers that it should be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marcel Sobieski, co-founder of TeslaThemes, <a href=\"http://teslathemes.com/blog/acquisition/\">thanked customers</a> for their support and confirmed that they exited the company on June 9th.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We built a solid, trusted and valuable business, that is needed on the market and is appreciated both by industry colleagues and clients,&#8221; Sobieski said.</p>\n<p>This is the second exit in the last six months for Sobieski and his team. The sale of TeslaThemes will allow them to focus on a new venture called <a href=\"http://www.wpmatic.io/\">WPMatic.io</a>, a one-on-one WordPress support and development company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The six years of experience that we have in WordPress is already helping a few hundred clients and tens of companies and agencies in need, right after purchasing a WP Theme from the market,&#8221; Sobieski said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Soon we will start partnering with some of the best WP Theme Clubs to deliver a unique experience for their clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition of TeslaThemes represents Imagely&#8217;s first major move into the general WordPress products market. The company is also seeking acquisition opportunities for other WordPress plugin and theme companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the coming years, we&#8217;ll be both building and be acquiring a range of other WordPress theme and plugin companies,&#8221; Danzer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll even add a small call here: if you have a solid WordPress product, with a great brand and stable revenue over around $200,000, and you are looking to exit, feel free to reach out to me directly to chat.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Correction: June 14th, 2017</strong> The article incorrectly identifies Imagely as the creators of NextGEN Gallery.

You can use them for commercial and noncommercial purposes. You do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or Unsplash, although it is appreciated when possible.</p>\n<p>More precisely, Unsplash grants you a nonexclusive copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash. <strong>This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The inability to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service is a restriction on how the photos can be used, calling into question its compatibility with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Luke Chesser, co-founder of Unsplash, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukechesser/status/873146783945416704\">explained on</a> Twitter that individual photos have no restrictions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Unsplash license doesn&#8217;t violate GPL and can still be used in WordPress themes,&#8221; Chesser said. &#8220;There are no restrictions on the individual photos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only a restriction on the collection of photos, which doesn&#8217;t even apply unless your intent is to create a similar service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, it&#8217;s ok if someone creates a site that displays the best photos of bridges from Unsplash. But if the site makes those photos available for download, it would <a href=\"https://community.unsplash.com/help-section/do-i-have-to-give-credit-to-a-photographer-when-i-use-their-photo\">violate the license</a>.</p>\n<p>On its FAQ page, Unsplash <a href=\"https://community.unsplash.com/help-section/what-is-the-unsplash-license-and-where-can-i-find-it\">explains why</a> the restriction was put in place:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The fuel that drives Unsplash is the exceptional images that are generously contributed by people from all over the world. Without them, none of this would work. Unsplash would be nothing. We owe everyone who’s contributed a photo not only a thank you but support and empowerment for the gifts they’ve given us.</p>\n<p>Out of respect for our contributors and our ability to uphold our value of empowering creativity, we added this sentence to the Unsplash License.</p>\n<p>We don’t support the mass duplication of Unsplash photos with the purpose of replicating a similar or competing service because it leads to confusion which negatively impacts both the spirit of open creative use and the celebration of Unsplash contributors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mass compiling of photos from Unsplash to distribute on other sites has created legal issues in the past. &#8220;Sites that mass duplicate and compile Unsplash photos point support and legal issues back to Unsplash, while continuing to redistribute photos that may be removed on Unsplash,&#8221; the company said.</p>\n<p>The reasons cited by Unsplash for putting the restriction in place are some of the same reasons WordPress plugin developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-gpl-license-doesnt-provide-the-freedom-to-infringe-registered-trademarks\">register trademarks</a>. The GPL allows the following freedoms.</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>\n<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</li>\n<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>\n<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over the years, there have been many instances in the WordPress community where businesses have taken advantage of these freedoms merely to profit from the work of others.</p>\n<p>The reselling of commercial plugins causes confusion in the market and resellers typically point support and other inquiries back to the plugin&#8217;s developers.</p>\n<p>Trademarks give commercial plugin authors measures to protect their brand without violating the GPL. A good example is the <a href=\"http://www.gravityforms.com/trademark/\">GravityForms Trademark page</a> which clearly outlines how its brand can be used and displayed.</p>\n<p>For now, it appears that most people who use Unsplash will be unaffected by the licensing change. However, as long as there is one license that governs the use of images and it has at least one restriction, its compatibility with the GPL will remain in doubt.</p>\n<p><strong>Correction June 14th</strong> Luke Chesser, co-founder of Unsplash, did not say that individual photos are still CC0-licensed but rather, have no restrictions.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jun 2017 21:27:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:131:\"WPTavern: Major Update Coming to WP Super Cache: New REST API, User-Friendly Settings Page, and Improvements to Legacy File Storage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71718\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:139:\"https://wptavern.com/major-update-coming-to-wp-super-cache-new-rest-api-user-friendly-settings-page-and-improvements-to-legacy-file-storage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2550:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-super-cache.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Super Cache</a>, a WordPress caching plugin maintained by Donncha Ó Caoimh and Automattic, is looking for users to help test the plugin <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2017/06/07/take-a-sneak-peek-at-wp-super-cache/\" target=\"_blank\">ahead of the next major update</a>. Ó Caoimh said the upcoming release is in a &#8220;stable and usable&#8221; state, but with the unusually large number of bug fixes and new features, it could use some testing in different environments.</p>\n<p>WP Super Cache is set to introduce a REST API, which will be useful for situations where administrators are not using wp-admin to manage their sites. The plugin is also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177\" target=\"_blank\">changing the location for storing legacy cache files</a> to the supercache directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This makes it easier to manage these files,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;The plugin doesn’t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous “supercache” files will be. I’m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged-in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ó Caoimh is also updating the settings page to make it easier for new users to understand the options. Currently it asks the user to select from mod_rewrite, PHP, or Legacy page caching with little explanation for why a user might opt for a certain delivery method. The new settings page simplifies the language used to describe the caching types.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wp-super-cache-new-settings.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The upcoming release will also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\" target=\"_blank\">fix nearly 100 bugs</a>. As WP Super Cache is one of the most popular WordPress caching solutions and is active on more than a million sites, any problems with a major release will have a far-reaching impact.

The current venue they use was donated by <a href=\"http://motorepublik.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Moto Republik</a>, thanks to one of the members Munya Bloggo, who works there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was always the goal of the WordCamp Incubator program to organize an easily-reproducible event that we could organize independently in the years to come,&#8221; 2017 lead organizer <a href=\"https://franksweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Thabo Tswana</a> said. &#8220;We expected it of ourselves. Some attendees and organizers actually approached me about the next WordCamp during WordCamp Harare 2016.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tswana said the turnout at last year&#8217;s event was larger than he expected, because very few attendees booked tickets online. The majority ended up buying tickets at the door on the day of the event, a fairly uncommon scenario for most WordCamps that makes it somewhat difficult to estimate total attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest impacts that WordCamp had was introducing us to the WordPress Community,&#8221; Tswana said. &#8220;There are so many WordPress users in Zimbabwe (bloggers, designers, developers) but hardly anyone knew about the WordPress Community or how to contribute to WordPress. We now have a growing meetup group and the local community is starting to become more aware of what WordPress has to offer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The local community consists primarily of developers and advanced WordPress users and Tswana said he would like see more of them getting involved with contributing. As the majority of meetup members are new to the larger WordPress community, they are still learning about the many ways users can contribute back to the project.</p>\n<p>Two Harare WordPress Meetup members, Kudakwashe Zafevere and Rima Trew, arranged for Hellenic Academy to donate a venue for WordCamp Harare 2017. The facilities are well-suited to hosting a tech event with wifi available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This year, some local companies and organizations expressed interest in helping us out,&#8221; Tswana said. &#8220;We definitely expect more attendees due to the buzz that was created by last year&#8217;s WordCamp. To sum it all up, more people and organizations are getting involved this year.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jun 2017 02:33:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 “Evans” Released Featuring Nearby WordPress Events, New Media Widgets, and Link Boundaries\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=71534\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7169:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">WordPress 4.8 &#8220;Evans&#8221;</a> is available for download and is the first major release of the year under the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">new release cycle</a>. WordPress 4.8 is named after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans\">William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans</a>, an American jazz pianist.</p>\n<h2>New Image, Video, and Audio Widgets</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 includes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">three new widgets</a>. All three widgets make it easier to display images, video, or audio  without using HTML. The Text widget now has support for TinyMCE providing rich-text functionality. Similar to the post editor, users have a choice between using a Visual or Text editor with limited formatting options.</p>\n<img />Image, Video, and Enhanced Text Widget\n<p>Because the Text widget uses TinyMCE, it inherits its nuances when it comes to pasting and displaying code. In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">dev note</a> that explains how TinyMCE was added to the Text Widget, Weston Ruter offers the following notice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When pasting HTML into the &#8216;Text&#8217; (HTML) tab of the Text widget, any extraneous line breaks should be removed or else unwanted paragraphs and line beaks may result. This is particularly important when you paste in <code>script</code> or <code>style</code> tags (as in the case of 3rd-party JavaScript embeds), since auto-inserted paragraphs will cause script errors; this will be fixed in <span class=\"p2_hovercardify\"><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2833\">#2833</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This behavior aligns with longstanding behavior in the post editor, so it is not new, although it does differ from how the Text widget has previously behaved. As noted above, for previously existing Text widgets that had the auto-add paragraphs&#8217; checkbox unchecked (and thus the <code>filter</code> instance prop set to <code>false</code>), the previous behavior of not doing <code>wpautop</code> will be maintained: only once the widgets are modified will any extraneous line breaks need to be removed.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Adding and editing links in the visual editor is more intuitive thanks to link boundaries. Link boundaries provide a visual representation of where a link begins and ends. This helps prevent adding unnecessary text to the beginning or end of a link.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>See Nearby WordPress Events in the Dashboard</h2>\n<p>One of the pillars of WordPress&#8217; ecosystem is its community of meetups and WordCamps. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">In 2016</a>, more than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries. About a third of those were new members.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 draws attention to these events by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/23/showing-upcoming-local-events-in-wp-admin/\">enhancing the News Dashboard widget</a>. The widget will try to automatically guess your location and display meetups and WordCamps that are nearby.</p>\n<img />News Widget Shows Upcoming Meetups and WordCamps\n<p>If the location is incorrect, clicking the Pencil button opens a box where you can type in your city. The bottom of the widget includes links to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups-landing-page\">WordPress Meetup landing page</a>, <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">WordCamp Central Schedule</a>, and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress.org news blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Responsive Customizer Sidebar</h2>\n<p>In previous versions of WordPress, the Customizer Sidebar had a maximum width of 300 pixels. In WordPress 4.8, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-increases-maximum-width-of-the-customizer-sidebar-to-600-pixels\">Customizer Sidebar is responsive</a> and its width will automatically increase based on the size of the screen up to a maximum of 600 pixels.</p>\n<img />Customizer Sidebar 345 Pixels Wide\n<h2>More Accessible Admin Pages</h2>\n<p>The headers on admin screens are now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-improves-accessibility-on-admin-screens\">separate elements</a> making it easier for assistive technologies to help people navigate pages.</p>\n<h2>Support Dropped for Internet Explorer Versions 8, 9, and 10</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/\">drops support</a> for Internet Explorer versions 8, 9, and 10 as these versions no longer receive security updates and are used by a small percentage of people. WordPress 4.8 will work in these browsers but some features related to TinyMCE will be limited. New features will no longer be tested against these older versions of IE.</p>\n<h2>Noteworthy Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/20/editor-api-changes-in-4-8/\">Changes to the Editor API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Embeds of WMV and WMA files are no longer supported</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">New Capabilities and others enhancements for WordPress Multisite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/tag-cloud-widget-changes-in-4-8/\">Accessibility improvements to the Tag Cloud widget</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">The addition of a Media Widgets API</a></li>\n<li>TinyMCE was updated from version <strong>4.5.6</strong> to version <strong>4.6.2</strong></li>\n<li>Twemoji was updated from version <strong>2.2.2</strong> to version <strong>2.3.0</strong></li>\n<li>zxcvbn was updated from version <strong>1.0</strong> to version <strong>4.4.1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>. 346 people contributed to WordPress 4.8 and 106 of them were first time contributors.</p>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ve discovered a bug in WordPress 4.8, read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/read-this-first-wordpress-4-8-master-list/\">this support thread</a> first to see if it&#8217;s a common issue that&#8217;s already been reported.

The <a href=\"https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">WCEU Paris Guide app</a> includes location and transportation information, schedules for the event, suggestions on where to eat (restaurants, bistros, a selection of the best cheap eats), a list of top attractions and museums, and nightlife recommendations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wceu-paris-guide.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Worona has released an <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worona.paris.app\" target=\"_blank\">Android app</a> and an <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1238819389&mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS app</a> for attendees to download. Currently the app needs to be connected to the internet, but the company is working on supporting an offline mode in the next version, which is rolling out soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We used our online platform to turn a WordPress blog (<a href=\"https://paris.worona.org\" target=\"_blank\">paris.worona.org</a>) into a native app,&#8221; Reyes Martínez, Worona&#8217;s marketing and communications specialist, said. &#8220;We use React and fetch the content using the WP-API. The apps are created with <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cordova</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is a relatively new WordPress startup in Europe, having released its first prototype in late 2014. The company offers its mobile app building platform to users for free via its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/worona/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin on WordPress.org</a>. The platform turns WordPress sites into native mobile apps that users can publish to the app stores. Worona can also manage the process of publishing the app for a one-time 290€ fee.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Worona had more than 12,000 users from 150 different countries. After launching its new platform four months ago, more than 11,500 users have signed up.</p>\n<p>Martínez said that Worona differs from existing WordPress app builders in that it is free, user-friendly, completely open source, and extensible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We studied the WordPress ecosystem and the mobile distribution trends during the last three years and realized that other existing solutions, such as AppPresser, are just focused on one or two mobile channels, but not in all of them,&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;This can be a problem for publishers, as they have to configure the different channels (apps, web apps, AMP, Facebook Instant Articles) one by one and take care of being consistent with all of them. After launching our own beta in 2015 and testing similar solutions, we decided to develop an all-in-one platform with the vision of becoming the leading solution for mobile distribution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is also aiming to create an ecosystem of extensions and themes for the platform, allowing third-party developers to create new solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The strategy of creating a marketplace of extensions has been successfully accomplished by the WordPress ecosystem before (but not by any of our direct competitors),&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;WooCommerce, for example, gives you access to a variety of extensions aiming to solve any problems related to your e-commerce. Because it is open-source, these features can be created by any developer or user. The bigger the community, the higher the range of solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is currently a team of five, including two co-founders, a marketing specialist, and two full-stack developers. Most of the team will be at WordCamp Europe. They hope the <a href=\"https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">WCEU Paris Guide app</a> will be useful for attendees and also provide a good introduction to their product. If you have any feedback that would make the app more useful, make sure to <a href=\"https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">comment on the announcement</a> and Worona may be able to incorporate user suggestions before the event.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:32:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.8 “Evans”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40695:\"<h2>An Update with You in Mind</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4816\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/release-featured-image.png?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!</h3>\n<p>Version 4.8 of WordPress, named &#8220;Evans&#8221; in honor of jazz pianist and composer William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.8 add more ways for you to express yourself and represent your brand.</p>\n<p>Though some updates seem minor, they’ve been built by hundreds of contributors with <em>you</em> in mind. Get ready for new features you’ll welcome like an old friend: link improvements, <em>three</em> new media widgets covering images, audio, and video, an updated text widget that supports visual editing, and an upgraded news section in your dashboard which brings in nearby and upcoming WordPress events.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Exciting Widget Updates</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4776 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/widgets-with-all-four.png?resize=632%2C436&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3>Image Widget</h3>\n<p>Adding an image to a widget is now a simple task that is achievable for any WordPress user without needing to know code. Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world? WordPress now draws your attention to the events that help you continue improving your WordPress skills, meet friends, and, of course, publish!</p>\n<p>This is quickly becoming one of our favorite features. While you are in the dashboard (because you’re running updates and writing posts, right?) all upcoming WordCamps and official WordPress Meetups — local to you — will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Being part of the community can help you improve your WordPress skills and network with people you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet. Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Even More Developer Happiness <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/\">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like “Add New” links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings.

Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

The plugin offers a lightweight, elegant popup message for capturing email addresses, displaying a (fake) live chat, or announcing a sale or event.</p>\n<p>Bolinger designed it to be non-intrusive &#8211; it&#8217;s not the kind of modal dialog that obscures content with an animated box in the middle of the page. Holler Box appears at the bottom right-hand of the page by default.</p>\n<p>After finding other WordPress popup plugins to be too complex for his needs, Bolinger decided to create his own solution for displaying a quick notification on his websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m a developer, and even adding a simple banner or popup to my site is not easy,&#8221; Bolinger said. I have to write the code, test locally, push to staging, test there, then push to production and do a final test. When I want to remove the message, I have to reverse the process. I’m busy, and that takes time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger made it so that creating a new Holler Box is as easy as writing a new blog post. The content editing screen includes a meta box with options for customizing the display.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box-meta-box.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221; meta box allows users to set pages where the notification should be displayed, limit to logged-in only or logged-out visitors, set the display for new or returning visitors, and customize the delay based on time or scrolling. It also gives options for when the Holler Box should disappear and how often it should be shown to each visitor.</p>\n<p>Holler Box is capable of a wide range of uses. A few examples include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(Fake) Live Chat with Opt-in</strong>\n<p>Show a live chat box to collect customer questions and emails, without having to actually deal with the hassle of live chat. As soon as your visitor types a question, an email opt-in pops up so you can follow up with them at a convenient time.</li>\n<li><strong>Polls and Forms</strong>\n<p>Embed anything into your Holler Box, including a feedback form or poll.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactivity</strong>\n<p>Add a link, video, contact form, or simple opt-in form that integrates with major email providers like MailChimp and Convertkit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is an example of how the MailChimp email opt-in form works:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Holler Box also tracks impressions and conversions (link clicks and message opens) so that users can see how well their notifications are performing and optimize them as needed.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/holler-box/\" target=\"_blank\">free version on WordPress.org</a> has an impressive number of customization options, but Bolinger also plans to release a Pro version that will include additional features, such as an option for a header banner, more advanced display filters, automatic message deactivation, advanced email opt-in features, more conversion data, and support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Holler Box aims to be more stylish and easier to use than existing options,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;I use it when I need to make an announcement without spending a lot of time in a complex tool.&#8221; He said he could see the plugin working well side-by-side with well-established popup plugin competitors like OptinMonster.</p>\n<p>Bolinger said Holler Box is not affiliated with AppPresser, but he plans to use it as a sales tool on all of his sites. The plugin&#8217;s unique feature set is something he found missing in WordPress&#8217; marketplace for sales/conversion tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Holler Box will increase sales and conversions without being as disruptive as other popups,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;The sale notification popup and faux live chat feature are really unique. It’s how I want to communicate with my audience &#8211; hopefully other people feel the same.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 01:37:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 276 – Interview with Jon Brown, a Traveling Digital Nomad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=71482&preview=true&preview_id=71482\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-276-interview-with-jon-brown-a-traveling-digital-nomad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2848:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://www.wanderingjon.com/\">Jon Brown</a>.

It&#8217;s stable and usable and runs on this site but we would love more people to test it out before we release a new version.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s just some of the new features and bug fixes we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The plugin was based on WP-Cache which stored cache files in a single directory, and those (legacy caching) files were for the most part stored the same way all this time but now they&#8217;re being placed in the supercache directories (<a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177\">#177</a>). This makes it easier to manage these files. The plugin doesn&#8217;t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous &#8220;supercache&#8221; files will be. I&#8217;m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.</li>\n<li> We&#8217;re adding a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">REST API</a> to the plugin because in the future not everyone is going to use wp-admin to take care of their sites. Take a look in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/tree/master/rest\">rest directory</a> for the code we&#8217;re working on.</li>\n<li> Debug logs now have a username and password to protect them from prying eyes.</li>\n<li> And many <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">bugs fixed</a> over the last few months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since &#8220;legacy caching&#8221; or &#8220;WP-Cache caching&#8221; is now more maintainable and faster we <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/issues/224\">want to change the language</a> describing how the plugin caches and delivers pages. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/files/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-07-at-17.35.25.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Currently the plugin asks you to choose between mod_rewrite, PHP and &#8220;Legacy page caching&#8221; which isn&#8217;t really useful. Most users won&#8217;t recognise those terms. It&#8217;s also not accurate as &#8220;legacy page caching&#8221; is active all the time as long as caching is enabled.<br />\nInstead we should have &#8220;Standard Caching&#8221; and &#8220;Super Caching&#8221;. Super Caching will then have simple and expert delivery methods.</p>\n<p>Simple delivery is through PHP, while expert delivery uses mod_rewrite rules which means the .htaccess file has to be updated and hopefully the warning below it will discourage casual users from testing it.</p>\n<p>Due to the huge number of changes in the plugin we really need people to give it a try and check if everything works ok. The <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/255\">changes to the settings page</a> will hopefully make it easier for new users to get to grips with it too.</p>\n<p>You can find the newest code <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache\">on Github</a>. The changes to the settings page are in <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/255\">#255</a> if you want to comment on them. </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin alsgruo allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href=\"https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href=\"https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you&#8217;re good at translating, please join us at <a href=\"http://translate.yoast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">translate.yoast.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>News SEO</h4>\n<p>Be sure to also check out the premium <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">News SEO module</a> if you need Google News Sitemaps.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'640\' height=\'390\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy.

To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type “WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;. That should return things to normal.</p>\n<h4>Dummy data</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes with some dummy data you can use to see how products look; either import dummy_data.xml via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/\">WordPress importer</a> or use our <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSV Import Suite plugin</a> to import dummy_data.csv and dummy_data_variations.csv.</p>\n<p><!--section=faq--></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Installation Instructions</dt>\n<dd>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 2.5 requires WordPress 4.1+</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 2.6 requires WordPress 4.4+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WooCommerce server requirements documentation</a> for a detailed list of server requirements.</p>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser.

You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table.

Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP. Please use with care!!</li>\n<li>Update to Spanish translation, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Updated Swedish translation</li>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.3.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where log would not get updated after it had been cleared</li>\n<li>Do plugin setup in &#8216;init&#8217; action</li>\n<li>Small update to Spanish translation file, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.2.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>(WordPress 3.0+) An invalid cookie can sometimes get sent multiple times before it gets cleared, resulting in multiple failed attempts or even a lockout from a single invalid cookie.

Thanks to Johannes Ruthenberg for the report that prompted this</li>\n<li>Removed auth cookie admin check for version 2.7.</li>\n<li>Make sure relevant values in $_COOKIE get cleared right away on auth cookie validation failure.
