== Description ==
The Fepper theme for WordPress includes templates generated by the [Fepper frontend prototyper](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-wordpress) as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the WordPress theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

This theme is ideal for incorporating Pattern Lab into your WordPress development flow. There is probably no other theme which provides any reasonable working interface between the two very different environments.
