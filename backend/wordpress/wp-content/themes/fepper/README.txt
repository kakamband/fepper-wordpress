== Description ==

The Fepper theme for WordPress includes templates generated by the 
[Fepper frontend prototyper](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-wordpress) 
as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the WordPress 
theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

This theme is ideal for incorporating Pattern Lab into your WordPress 
development flow. There is probably no other theme which provides any 
reasonably working interface between the two very different environments.

== Installation ==

* You may install this as you would normally install a contributed WordPress 
  theme. See https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes 
  for further information.
* However, it is highly recommended to use this theme with a complete Fepper 
  prototyper.
* With that being known, it should also be known that this theme is included 
  within a fully configured WordPress backend in the Fepper for WordPress 
  project: https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-wordpress 
* This theme is unopinionated with regards to styles and markup and should be 
  used as a parent theme. You are encouraged to override any or all aspects of 
  this theme for your custom needs.
* However, if you wish to replicate the look and feel of the Fepper demo site 
  (as per the screenshot), you should follow the Fepper documentation on 
  importing the sample WordPress backend mentioned earlier. This will serve as a 
  starting point for further customization.
* You may also replicate this look and feel from a fresh WordPress install (with 
  no import):
  * Create "Hero" and "Tout" categories.
  * Assign a single post to the "Hero" category.
    * Give this a large 16x9 Featured Image.
  * Assign three posts to the "Tout" category.
    * Give each post a 4x3 Featured Image.
  * Posts assigned to the "Uncategorized" category will appear as blog listings
    on both the /home and the /blog pages.
